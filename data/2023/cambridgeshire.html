I spent 8 weeks at Addenbrooke&#39;s carrying out research looking at the concentration of tPA and NOx in chronic subdural haematomas. I enjoyed my placement and was able to have a realistic look at what it would be like to carry out my own research. I was given a lot of responsibility, so was able to direct the study (to an extent), whilst still having a lot of support and guidance. I would have liked to have been able to spend more time learning how to use statistical software and how to then use the data to support the study.<br /><br />IA student feedback:  Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. 8 weeks unpaid. It was incredibly useful and sparked my passion into medical research.

	<td>NOTHING AVAILABLE FOR SUMMER 2023<br /><br />AECOM is the second largest construction consultancy listed on the New York stock exchange. Although the US business has a significant consultancy and contracting side, the UK firm is exclusively an engineering design consultant. The Cambridge office is a regional UK office that specialises building engineering, employing structural engineers, M&E engineers, project managers, quantity surveyors, CDM coordinators and environmental consultants, with a total of around 60 employees in the Cambridge office (approximately 10 being structural engineers). They have Cambridge alumni currently within the engineering team and have historically as well.<br /><br />The student would be expected to have an interest in structural engineering. The placements usually last 6&#45;8 weeks and entail structural engineering design works (by hand and FEM modelling) of current engineering projects that the Cambridge office team is working on. Depending on what projects are live at the time of the placement, visits to live construction sites may also be available.  Experience within the construction industry is helpful, but not required.  Useful skills would be an aptitude for structures and basic computer literacy is assumed. Programming experience / ability beyond the University standard coursework is not required but is a useful bonus.<br /><br />Took an IA and IB student in 2019<br /><br />IA student feedback can be found on the Industrial Placements website: <br />https://www.placements.eng.cam.ac.uk/Search/Feedback/Feedback/aecom&#45;cambridge&#45;ia&#45;feedback<br /><br />IB STUDENT FEEDBACK: Overall, really good; interesting projects and exciting to see applications of things I have studied. Sometimes my lack of experience limited what I could work on, but I don&#39;t think there was anything that could have been done about that.

With only 3 permanent employees Archipelago is very small and I got to know everyone, and my supervisor helped me with any problems I had. Working at a small firm has the benefits of being a bigger cog in a small machine, and allows a lot more freedom and often more important projects for the actual company, however finding such a company can be a lot harder when doing the search as often times they may not have an official clear process for applying online like larger companies would. If you shine in interview stages, smaller companies are better as they prefer to do the applications in person rather than have some people from HR who have never spoken to you or don&#39;t even know your field filter you out for arbitrary reasons which you can never get feedback on.<br /><br />IB STUDENT FEEDBACK: Completed 3 weks paid over &#163;300 per week with free lunch.  Good placement a lot was learned in terms of practical skills in a short space of time. It is challenging to secure a placement with a lot of other companies not even responding to my emails.

For the software roles, they primarily use python, C#, C++, and mobile SDKs or frameworks such as Flutter. Skills or interest in user&#45;centric design, design for manufacture, and modelling systems (sensor physics) are also useful. They don&#39;t expect any one student will have all of these skills. As a start&#45;up, it is important to have broad skills and be able to learn quickly and with some independence.<br /><br />They like to see work samples such as a GitHub profile, project report, or photos of a student team engineering project.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 10 weeks paid. A very positive experience! My project was designing and coding an app for the company. Manager was very approachable and friendly. Had a few socials where possible, although the company was very small &#45; around 6 people in total. Doing the internship virtually allowed a lot of room to be flexible with working hours which I very much enjoyed. Salary was also very good.

	<td>ARM is at the heart of the world&#39;s most advanced digital products. Their technology enables the creation of new markets and transformation of industries and society. They design scalable, energy efficient&#45;processors and related technologies to deliver the intelligence in applications ranging from sensors to servers, including smartphones, tablets, enterprise infrastructure and the Internet of Things.<br /><br />ARM&#39;s interns work with industry experts on exciting, challenging projects that really impact the technological world. They look for students who want hands&#45;on experiences that put theory into practice. They also believe that developing your personal skills and confidence is just as vital to your future.<br /><br />They have a range of 3 months, 6 months and 12 months industry placements across their systems teams. The Systems IP team develops and delivers a wide range of differentiating technologies and products to internal and external customers. The Systems Development team builds compute systems integrating a multitude of ARM IPs including CPU, GPU, NPU and system IPs, targeting various market domains ranging from mobile phones, IoT devices, data centers and autonomous driving. <br /><br />Have taken CUED students for the last 9 years.<br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: 		Arm was a great first internship. It gave me an excellent introduction to industrial software engineering. The work culture was great and it was a great learning opportunity. However, the general consensus is that the work assigned to interns is not always very interesting. However, if you prove your abilities you can convince your manager to assign you pressing issues and get a chance to work with senior researchers in the company.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 	Excellent experience! I worked in the Systems team to help develop verification and testing tools. The team was very helpful and offered me advice and daily help. There were lots of training and resources available, and everyone was very supportive, despite the online nature.<br /><br />IA student feedback: remote internship for 	13 weks, paid over 350 per week plus social events, on&#45;site gym, subsidised lunch.  	The project I was assigned was fun and involved a lot of real CPU design work. The culture was very supportive and the colleagues were really easy to get on with. They also make effort to organise loads of socials for the interns (though this summer they were virtual). There weren&#39;t really any negatives!<br /><br />IA student feedback: 		The 12 weeks internship at Arm was well organized and I learnt a great deal through working on projects. Arm is a big company which has a lot of teams, each intern was assigned to a team (a team normally consists of 8&#45;15 people, a mixture of PTUGs and permanent employees) initially. It is then up to the team to decide our work packages after discussion with your team members. Nearly everyone does coding in their day&#45;to&#45;day job, mostly Python and C++ although some teams will code in proprietary languages. The community is very helpful and the work culture at Arm is one of the best I have experienced. The good thing about Arm is that you will learn gain a lot of practical coding skills and the application side of software and hardware programming. Interns are fully integrated into a team so work contributes directly to the business. The office is modern and has facilities like showers and gym which are free to use. Furthermore, Arm has great perks and bonuses so it is an attractive place to work. The challenging bit is that learning curve is steep, just getting familiarise with the language and flows can weeks so be prepared to ask a lot of questions.  						<br /><br />IB student feedback:	The internship was very exciting! I was working on a project that would eventually reach a customer after some review, so I felt very useful for the duration of my internship. There was plenty of support, and people were very open to questions even if it was via Slack from an intern they had never met before!<br /><br />1A student feedback: It was an exceptionally enriching experience. Great culture, great people and great opportunities to kick&#45;start your careers. I worked with awesome people and learned a lot about computer engineering that cannot be taught in a lecture theatre. Very motivational.<br /><br />IB student feedback: It was very enjoyable working for Arm. The company has a great work culture that strongly encourages asking of questions. Everyone is really friendly and always willing to put down their own work for a quick chat or to help an intern out. People are understanding towards anyone needing more time to get up to speed with the work, and there&#39;s strong communication within each team. The work itself can be challenging, but also very rewarding once gotten hang of. Even interns are directly involved in frontier level work, contributing directly to products that will be delivered to customers and eventually have far&#45;reaching influence in the industry. The work arrangements were also very flexible, allowing workers to work from home if necessary. The office is really big and nice, and there are free burgers and ice cream days. Definitely recommend.<br /><br />1B student feedback: Amazing team, ARM takes a lot of interns and they know how to allocate resources. I was given a lot of responsibility which was good.<br /><br />IB student feedback: For me the beginning part was slow, trying to work out where to start looking, but I found that once I had a really good internship in sight, doing what was necessary to apply required effort but was easy to think and map out in my head.<br />This process of application actually occurred over two years, where in first year I found many internships I liked but was under qualified to work on, so I made sure to acquire the skills in a UROP with the university that year, opening me up to these fun internships in my second year.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 12 week remote internship.  Had Summer internships with Arm in &#39;19 and &#39;20. They take a lot of interns, so the opportunities for socialising and group events are great. You&#39;ll have 2 managers dealing with various aspects of your rotation, and generally you&#39;ll get an interesting project in your chosen department that contributes in some manner to your team&#39;s core work. Both of my projects were fulfilling and required a decent amount of independence to learn the ropes of Arm&#39;s business, as CUED doesn&#39;t cover much of the day&#45;to&#45;day skills needed in the semiconductor industry. At the same time my managers were very helpful in getting me familiarised with the systems and tools required whenever I needed help. Management is not too hierarchical, and it&#39;s perfectly acceptable for interns to engage with upper management on problems &#45; I occasionally reached out to people right at the top for help with issues within my minor projects. Teams and projects are centred on semiconductor efficiency, but Arm explores a lot of innovative ideas, so you can expect to work with multiple languages and frameworks. Despite COVID I had a fully&#45;fledged 12&#45;week internship in &#39;20 &#45; Arm even sent me the hardware to make it work, and it was as good as a remote internship could be. Interning here is a great way to find out if you actually like coding and want to work in hardware, as you&#39;ll be fully integrated into a real programming environment. Some things I really got up to scratch on thanks to Arm &#45; Python, SystemVerilog, bash, tcl, Git, Gerrit, verification, hardware logic, clock domains, and the basics of TensorFlow.

	<td>Autodesk makes software for people who make things. In particular, they write software for Engineering, Construction, Architecture, Media and Entertainment and more. The Cambridge office focusses on software used in mechanical engineering, and all their developers have a strong background in maths.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1B student feedback 2018: My internship experience was split into two halves, each working in a different team with a different programming language. It was exciting learning about all the new tech terms I hadn&#39;t come across before, and being exposed to the world of CAD programming, app frameworks and web development. I think things would have been a bit easier if I&#39;d practiced doing more programming logic questions beforehand. While I&#39;d really studied the syntax of the languages I was going to work with, I realise that this wasn&#39;t as helpful as I thought it would be. For example, just knowing the logic behind the algorithm for the optimum and different ways to sort a list off the top of my head would have saved me some time. (This advice may be less relevant to more experienced programmers).

The overarching aim is to develop elements that will form the next generation of Holographic radar processing techniques. <br /><br />FEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS INTERN: 2nd year student. Aveillant is a small company that are developing a new radar product for drone detection and are working in tandem with other companies to make an all round solution to the drone problem.  I was able to get involved in a lot while I was here and everything was always explained in detail whenever I asked for any guidance. While there, there were a few times when I had less to do, this was mainly due to the business of the period with lots of employees working on their own areas or out of the office.  Thoroughly recommended! Salary: 250&#45;350 per week and free lunch.

Bespak Innovation was set up over 10 years ago to grow and diversify the business and is based in Cambridge, UK. The Innovation Team is currently working on a number of projects to develop new injectable devices and are looking for engineering expertise to help assist in these projects. Their project teams typically consist of representatives from a range of disciplines, such as mechanical engineering and product design engineering, so the student will get exposure to the whole spectrum of expertise required to develop a medical device. The student will be given a mentor for the duration of their placement to guide their work and assist integration into our team. They have many alumni from Cambridge University, from their most recent new Graduate Mechanical Engineer to more experienced members of their team.<br /><br />Interns will join one of their project teams and carry out investigations into their devices. Likely activities range from lab based testing to theoretical analysis to presentation of results to the project team. As part of their team, the student will also be invited to their weekly and monthly meetings to find out about a broader range of projects and activities. <br /><br /><br />IB student feedback 2018: I&#39;m so glad there is a requirement to complete this requirement as it was incredibly valuable and it forced me to put myself out there in an environment I had never experienced before.  The experience was fantastic, I would highly recommend it to others as the small medium sized company means that you get to know a few really lovely people and the joint office/lab space means you get a variety of tasks, and you are really valued as an employee.

I have had the opportunity to do various types of work and learn many new things. All the people I was working with were very friendly and helpful and doing an internship at a company with a lot of other interns made the experience of living and working in an unfamiliar place much more enjoyable.<br /><br />IA student feedback 2018: I hold an IET Diamond scholarship, making me eligible to apply for the BT summer internship scheme without going to an assessment centre. The opportunity cam round for scholars to apply, so I did.  Worked in the BT research department using Python and bash to develop a system to capture and analyse bandwidth data, with a focus on the traffic generated by a games console.<br /><br />IA fedback: Earnt over 300 pounds per week for 12 weeks and found the job through the IET scholorship. Stayed at student accommodation at the University of Suffolk, arranged myself, The internship itself was great. However, Ipswich as a location wasn&#39;t a very exciting place. Accommodation was a btit difficult to organise and I had to move out near the end of the summer because it was student accommodation I was staying in. Transport was pretty convenient, with regular direct buses from anywhere in Ipswich to Martlesham where Adastral Park is.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 		The experience was great overall. Had be to aware and ready to learn on the job. Surprisingly, pretty much everything I did was new to me. Ability to code was handy though, even though I had to use a different coding architecture to ones I learnt in uni.<br /><br />They also have graduate opportunities in their research organisation<br /><br />Took a IA student in 2019 who was part of the IET Diamond Jubliee Scholorship.

	<td>A Cambridge based small business with over 25 years&#39; experience, delivering critical radar detection systems. Sensoriis designs and manufacturers micro radar sensors in a low size, weight, and power package, suitable for use on Uncrewed Air Vehicles (UAVs) or Drones, maximising automation, and minimising costs.   <br /><br />Their ARC&#45;Landing supports the autonomous landing of a UAV onto a vessel.  An ARC primary radar, installed onto the UAV, will actively cooperate with ARC secondaries on the moving vessel, enabling relative positioning during the critical approach and landing phases of drone flight. Their RadarAware technology, installed onto the drone, detects objects in flight and instantly relays data to onboard flight controllers for automatic avoidance control. <br /><br />Experience of flying, or customising UAVs (drones) or flight controller systems, would be highly desirable. Or prior autonomy experience or interest upon other mobile platforms. An understanding of extended Kalman filters would also be an advantage, though not essential.

Having graduated from the CERN Business Incubation Centre at STFC&#39;s Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire.<br /><br />Camstech was established in 2014 with a vision to commercialise a novel sensing technology developed by Professor Pankaj Vadgama, initially for life sciences research and subsequently for applications in biotechnology and medical diagnostics. In 2015 the company identified intellectual property at CERN that would enable them to scale up and manufacture their sensors, cost effectively and at highly competitive production costs compared with standard processes. The technology Camstech licensed is being used on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) upgrade. Licensing of this manufacturing technology from CERN provided Camstech with a key way forward in realising its vision and in bringing their sensors to market.

	<td>Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute was the first major new cancer research centre in the UK for over 50 years. Their goal is to combine world leading basic cancer biology with key technologies to bear on practical questions of cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention.<br /><br />Their eight&#45;week Undergraduate Summer Research Programme aims to inspire bright and ambitious undergraduates to start their careers in cancer research.  The programme provides immersive hands&#45;on research experience, with students able to work on their own research project in one of their world&#45;leading Research Groups.<br /><br />This opportunity is offered to students who intend to pursue PhD study after completing their current degree. Each student will be embedded in one of their multidisciplinary Research Groups to work on their own project, with access to their state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art Core Facilities. They offer a range of projects each year, from basic experimental and computational cancer biology through translational cancer research to clinical application.<br /><br />Students work under the supervision of a postdoctoral or PhD researcher and participate in lab meetings. You will have the opportunity to network with Group Leaders at weekly lunchtime lectures and towards the end of your study period, you will be expected to write a brief scientific report on your research project and present your findings at the Summer School Symposium.

Really enjoyed working here &#45;people were welcoming, I got good support for learning everything I needed to learn (which was quite a bit as most of what we were doing was new to me &#45; but I very much enjoyed learning so many new things), the project they gave me was interesting. <br />In terms of social events there is the opportunity to go to the pub practically every Friday lunchtime if you so wish &#45; you pay for your own food (which is very good) but it&#39;s not uncommon for someone else to pay for the drinks. <br />I will say that there are currently not many options on the research park itself for your lunch break as the cafe has closed, though there are the occasional food trucks (which are OK, not great, and the time they arrive can be variable).<br />In general I think the company is a good mix of challenging and interesting work with a generally relaxed and friendly atmosphere.

	<td>Cooper Roller Bearings has a long tradition of highly skilled engineering using very traditional technioques of casting hot metal  very unusual in the UK these days. They also have their own pattern makers to make the wooden moulds for casting the components, a highly skilled manual craft. Plus they still train their own apprentices. Allied to this is the utilisation of the latest state of the art 5 axis machines that automtically perform several operations on the same component to a very high specification. So you have the best of Uk engineering traditions allied to state of the art machinery and procedures to stay competitive in the market. <br /><br />The bearings are critical compenents used in large machines such as ships propellors, turbines and other operations where long heavy metal shafts need to be kept on track. Precision skill and quality are embodied in their products. <br /><br />For anyone who wants to see how a traditionally based engineering industry has maintained its competitive global edge  by adopting modern working practices, this is the place to go.

However, this was good as it gave me time to learn a  few of the structural engineering specific programs that they use, so that once I was assigned to the projects I could work more effectively as I already have an understanding of the programs they wanted me to use.<br />The actual work I did was really interesting. I got to design the foundations for several projects and then helped in the structural analysis and re&#45;design of a new project. It made me more sure that structural engineering is the route I want to go down.

The work that I carried out personally involved a large amount of python programming and data collection, using a test rig to collect current and voltage data which is then subjected to a Fourier transform and analysed. Their office is very conveniently located in the centre of Cambridge and the experience was overall quite useful.

	<td>POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILLED FOR SUMMER 2023<br /><br />FLIT is a Cambridge based start&#45;up developing folding ebikes. They are a small team of engineers and designers with a workshop in the north of Cambridge. Their team of engineers and designers, including two recent grads, take ideas from early concept all the way to production.<br /><br />The work they do at FLIT requires them to strike a delicate balance between design aesthetics, user interaction, manufacturability, cost, and marketing. It&#39;s this balancing act that makes product design so interesting and challenging. They have basic in&#45;house prototyping facilities (FDM and SLA printers, workshop tools, pneumatic test rigs) for a full range of concept generation, CAD and physical prototyping. <br /><br />They look for students that have an appreciation for product design. If you like sketching concepts, UX design and building simple works&#45;like prototypes, you&#39;ll be a great fit.<br /><br /><br />IIA student feedback. Paid for 8 weeks. 	I was tasked with designing an environmental test rig for their bike, this means testing their bike subjected to vibration in varying temperature, another rig for parts exposure to UV light, and another rig for salt spray. I was concentrating on temperature control on the first rig and a separate light box for UV testing. Flit is a small startup, so you don&#39;t work with a lot of people. But that also mean you will be quite independent, entrusted with completing the task they give you, and the people are pretty relaxed and friendly. I was able to have flexible hours, and my line manager was always attentive on my inquiries and discussions, and very willing to help when I was making the rig itself. Only bad bit might be the physical workspace, as again, they are quite small.

	<td>Gearset is one of the fastest growing tech startups in Cambridge, UK. Its mission is to make Salesforce release management ingeniously simple. It offers a relatively new SaaS&#45;based release management and DevOps tool that has quickly become relied upon by some of the biggest companies in the world.<br /><br />Gearset know what a good internship looks like &#45; lots of their developers started out as interns. They strongly believe that internships should be about doing real work and making a real difference from day one, not watching other people do things.<br /><br />All applications will be reviewed from the end of October  and interviews start from November  and last until all of the positions have been filled.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 10 weeks paid over &#163;400 per week. 	Think the most unique part was that Gearset&#39;s frequent releases meant that things I coded made their way into the product from day 2

They believe the engineering of aircraft requires a hollistic approach to all aspects of flight, from the stuctural and aerodynamic interactions to the pilot&#39;s feel. They mostly use simple tools and a practical approach minimising cost and, in case of airworthiness, making the approval process easier.<br /><br />Interesting work available on new aircraft including power plant, structures and control.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 6 weeks unpaid with free lunch.<br />The internship was a great experience where I learnt a lot more than I expected and was useful to confirm that this is what I want to work in.

	<td>Graphmasters is a diverse company of 60 people with offices in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Australia and the UK. They created the first collaborative routing platform in the world and have been striving to make traffic better ever since. Their customers include parcel delivery companies, cities, postal services, supermarkets and car manufacturers. They optimise routes for everyone. <br /><br />The UK team currently consists of 5 people working on core technologies upon which most of their other products are built. Most of the team is made up of Cambridge alumni. <br /><br />As a technology focused company (all of the founders are computer scientists) they always try to push the boundary of what can be achieved. It is an environment where everyone is given responsibility no matter the role. They encourage everyone to try out things and not be afraid of failure. Also, their focus is on creating technology, not strict office hours.<br /><br />For internships they usually try to find a project that is both beneficial for the company and aligned with the intern&#39;s interests. It has to be something that can be completed over the summer. <br /><br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: 		The company is based in Germany and the UK office focuses on research problems. Hence, it is a good place to begin learning about software development. The people are friendly and provided a lot of help for me as I was a beginner in software development.

	<td>Heartfelt Technologies is developing a video&#45;based solution to in&#45;home patient monitoring.<br /><br />After a heart failure, patients are typically discharged and asked to monitor their health, and receive regular visits from healthcare professionals. At this point our monitor can be installed in the patient&#39;s home by the carer, as simply as a picture hung on a wall.<br /><br />Our device is a camera system, which automatically captures cardiovascular information whenever the patient simply walks past the monitor.<br /><br />The data is then transmitted to &#39;the cloud&#39; for further processing and flagging of high&#45;risk patients. Once flagged, our data feeds into existing telemedicine monitoring systems allowing carers and medical professionals to take prompt action.

(Very central and convenient for commuting) Great opportunity to learn the ins and outs of software development. Projects tend to be tailored given the company needs but I got to learn a huge amount of things in all areas of software development including end to end deployment of different services.<br />Personally I worked with React and Typescript to create a front end website for interactive data visualisation, backend data modelling using Python, AWS for managing cloud computing services and Docker/CircleCI/Terraform/Kubernetes for service deployment and integration. I was given a project to work on for the entire duration so I felt like the work was entirely my own and I had creative ability to expand as I saw fit. Paid &#163;725 a week so certainly a competitive salary!

An outstanding charity, and employer. They offered a wide variety of tasks over the summer, that could be tailored to suit the experience you were looking for. It was a chance to work on technology that is incredibly useful in the developing world.  Lots of advice and mentoring offered also.  Would strongly recommend!<br /><br />IA student feedback: Very hands&#45;on work, with plenty of opportunity to build up practical skills. <br />&#45; Very friendly atmosphere, the staff were really accomodating and willing to offer advice and support. Some staff have been abroad as part of HoverAid&#39;s aid work, and it was really exciting to hear about these experiences.<br />&#45; More of an adventure than an internship! We camped at the farm where the workshop was located, which was lovely in the summer evenings.

I am currently developing a prototype, so I&#39;m writing software, designing/CAD/machining bits and integrating lots of different hardware. <br />I&#39;m really enjoying it at the moment.  Everyone is really friendly, I&#39;m getting lots of help and the right amount of supervision. Plus pay is GBP10/hr which is fantastic. Also the company develops all their stuff from scratch internally which is really cool and probably quite rare, I really like their approach to things, it&#39;s very hands on and down to earth. I&#39;m really interested in robotics/automation so I just googled hard. I went there for a fairly relaxed interview and they gave me it there and then. Mr Huxley and Mr Bertram are ex&#45;Cambrdige Engineers so they were pretty keen.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 8 weeks paid over &#163;250 per week.

Their vision is a decarbonised world: powered by hydrogen and built on graphene.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: Small company of ~5 develops machines to produce graphene &#45; now focusing on using it to convert methane into hydrogen (byproduct of graphene). Lots of independent work researching existing solutions/devices to integrate, as well as CAD designing and prototyping (with 3D printers) new designs. Had some trouble agreeing to questionable contract, but staff were very friendly beyond negotiating legalities.<br /><br />IA student feedback:  My internship was a great learning experience. As the company focuses on R and D with the graphene they produced, the work for the interns was never repetitive and always new. I was also able to go through every step in an R and D process. The company is small and therefore the atmosphere is very friendly. Salary: 250&#45;300 pounds per week. Was there for 9 weeks.

	<td>Linx Printing Technologies Ltd is a leading provider of industrial coding and product marking. They provide breakthrough technological solutions used on production lines around the world and deliver leading customer experiences on a global scale.<br /><br />You could be working to help their system test team in building prototypes of one of their most innovative products and test them according to the test plan defined together with their Test lead. <br />They look for someone very driven and organised who likes working in a team and who can deliver exceptional results. Would be open to welcoming Year 1 students if they are eager to excel and can learn fast.<br /><br />IB student feedback: Well managed practical projects where I was able to produce tangibly useful work for the company. All manufacturing engineers leave before 3pm on Fridays, which is good for people wanting to go home for the weekend, as I did. However, travel to st Ives from Cambridge can make the day feel long.

	<td>Lucida Medical is a medical imaging AI startup based in Cambridge, with close links to the University and technology ecosystem. They apply AI and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to oncology. Their vision is to disrupt the cancer diagnostic pathway with technology that finds cancer precisely and quickly, enabling patients to receive the best possible diagnosis and treatment, ultimately saving lives.<br /><br />With top of the field academic and industry co&#45;founders, key opinion leaders as advisors and strong financial backing by investors, they are looking for highly enthusiastic, open minded individuals to join their team. This is an exciting opportunity to join a startup from an early stage and grow with the company.<br /><br />Internships are available in Machine Learning and Clinical Research.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 12 weeks remote paid internship. <br />Great! As the company is in its early stages, there is scope for a lot of activities. I worked with software development of the prostate cancer AI tool, and getting it ready for production. I also spent a some time looking at how the medical AI product was being registered as a medical device &#45; there is a lot of paperwork and regulations that need to be met! The supervisor (also CEO) Antony Rix is very supportive, and he really does appreciate that interns do not always have a lot of experience with data science tools.<br /><br /><br />IIA student feedback: I was given a project to work on over the summer and assigned a supervisor that would regularly check on my progress and provide help as well. The company is still in early stages, so you get the chance to get very involved and see your work make it all the way to the final product. I had never worked with Deep Learning models before but I was given plenty of support and encouragement to complete my project successfully. I was also provided with a laptop to work with and pay was good &#45; very friendly and welcoming atmosphere overall! <br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: 12 weeks remote and in person internship. Over &#163;350 per week.<br />Working at Lucida Medical was great &#45; I learnt a lot and contributed to a lot. The work involved machine learning. There were two interns this year. The company is quite small but is growing. The team at Lucida is great and it was a pleasure working with them.

I was on a rotation so that I got to see different parts of the company and work with different people on various projects. The work I was given was interesting and relevant and I was treated as a fellow employee by everyone I worked with which made the job a lot easier and more enjoyable. There were times where I wasnt given much work, but this was due to the short time I was at the department/company so it wasnt practical for me to work on long projects. I was given a mentor for the time I was there who I could speak to in the event of any problems I had. There were regular meetings to check how the internship was going and to get my feedback on what I was enjoying or could change for the future. I also got the chance to go on some of the aircraft which was very interesting!<br /><br />Average recruitment timeline: Accepting applications in Michaelmas term, shortlist of applications made in December, assessment days held in January, offers made in February with a view to a start date in June.

Engineers and scientists worldwide rely on its products to accelerate the pace of discovery, innovation, and development. <br /><br /><br /><br />IIA student feedback can be found on the Industrial Placements website: https://www.placements.eng.cam.ac.uk/Search/Feedback/Feedback/mathworks&#45;cambridge&#45;iia&#45;feedback<br /><br />IB student feedback: I worked on an applications programming team for Matlab online, I primarily programmed in C++. The work was interesting and I was given freedom to architect and design my features. The team are used to working with interns/ graduates placements so there was plenty of support. However there were few opportunities for social events especially outside of my direct team. <br /><br />IIA Student feedback: 10 weeks, paid over &#163;500 per week.<br />My overall experience at the MathWorks was an extremely positive one. The internship programme was a part of the &#39;Engineering Development Group&#39; at the company, which was to raise awareness of their graduate scheme. My internship lasted 10 weeks, and was in the area of software engineering and also machine learning. The induction and training process was very organized, and was extremely helpful in getting me up to speed with the skills required for the role. We were assigned a manager, EDG buddy, and a mentor; the manager&#39;s role was to check in once every two weeks to see if we were facing any problems, or if we wanted to ask any questions. The EDG buddy was someone in the EDG graduate scheme, and helped me with more of the day to day questions. The mentor&#39;s role was to help guide me and answer any questions we had about our main project, the mentor usually being a senior software developer within a specific product team we were assigned to. <br />Each intern had a main project they were involved in, and were each assigned a product team within MathWorks &#45; some examples are the Deep Learning team (which I was in), Simulink, Simscape, etc. We were invited to all the team&#39;s meetings, and were treated as an actual member of the team. We also had weekly meetings with the other interns to see what sort of projects they were working on, as well as social events. <br />The internship was purely remote, mainly using Microsoft Teams as our mode of communication. All interns were assigned a virtual desktop, with the option to obtain a company laptop if we needed one. There were about 10 &#45; 12 interns in total. <br />Overall, I felt I learnt lots about software engineering and deep learning, and was very satisfied with the internship in general. The working hours were flexible, and there was a heavy emphasis on not working outside normal working hours, which was great. The company culture and environment was also very supportive, and had a heavy focus on collaboration.

	<td>PragmatIC is a world leader in ultra low cost flexible electronics, enabling the potential for trillions of smart objects that can engage with consumers and their environments. Their unique technology platform delivers flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs) that are thinner than a human hair and can be easily embedded into everyday objects.<br /><br />Projects will likely involve programming in Python and interpreting voltage and current data from PragmatIC&#39;s FlexICs. Knowledge of other programming languages, data analysis, and electrical testing would be beneficial.<br />  <br /><br />IB student feedback: The company has a relaxed atmosphere and enthusiastic colleagues. The projects are interesting and meaningful for the company and my supervisor gave frequent feedback and freedom to do explore and learn on the job.<br /><br />Read here about one students experience:  https://www.pragmatic.tech/newsroom/blog/investing&#45;in&#45;future&#45;innovators<br /><br />IA student feedback:<br />I enjoyed my placement very much. I was given a lot of choice as to the type of project I wanted to do, and throughout the internship had to do a variety of different tasks to complete my project, which kept it interesting. It was also nice being given one project to work on for the whole 11 weeks, as I could really make it my own and I was very happy with my final product. As I was the only one working on my project, I had to complete all the different parts of it myself, which was a great opportunity to learn fields I had never experienced before such as GUI programming and 3D printing. All in all a great placement and would very much recommend to future students. My only advice to future students would be to not be afraid to ask for help, the staff are lovely and always willing to help with anything you need.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 10 weeks paid &#163;300 per week pluss social events, free snacks and lunches at work occasionally and a aid trip to their second sight near Darlington to see their assembly and clean rooms.<br />My time at PragmatIC was wonderful: the staff were all friendly and very helpful, our project was meaningful and resulted in a final product and presentation successful enough that the company have continued to develop and use it since we&#39;ve left. I was able to practice a lot of skills (ie: soldering, C++/python, image&#45;processing, Arduino/Raspberry pi electronics, practical manufacture and shaping skills, etc) and learn a lot about communications technology and decoding and encoding along the way. I would strongly recommend it to any undergraduates looking to develop their practical, teamwork and long&#45;term project management skills as well as put some of the course&#39;s theory into practice.

I was amazed that the company would give this many gadgets. <br /><br />The first two weeks or so was very boring with loads of reading material to go through, but later I got quite involved in the actual development process of the chips the company was working on. <br />By the last month, I was juggling multiple tickets at once. <br /><br />There was plenty of support in the team. I was comfortable asking help to anyone, even someone not involved in your job. Even the highest manager didn&#39;t mind spending significant time with you debugging.  There&#39;s no formality as to how you should speak to your manager etc. My manager would appreciate my contribution  and tried hard to make me feel like an equal. Other team members were very respective too as they will always ask whether I&#39;m busy or not to help their work rather than forcing certain tasks on me.

	<td>Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. They  connect users to the streaming content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers with unique capabilities to engage consumers.<br /><br />As an intern, you will work on meaningful projects and help solve real problems. To ensure a great experience, their program is guided by three key principles: Mentorship; Real&#45;world experience; Collaboration and trust.<br /><br />If you have any questions about the roles or application process, feel free to email Jo Holewik.<br /><br />IB student feedback: This is an amazing opportunity for anyone looking to gain any experience in software/ QA engineering. The interview process is really chill, and they give you plenty feedback if you request for it. I recommend leetcode for algorithms, but they&#39;re really just looking for passionate and friendly &#39;adults&#39;. <br />The Roku Cambridge office is located in the Science Park, which is a 10&#45;15 min cycle / bus ride, and you get to use the company showers! There is a mountain of free benefits, so don&#39;t be shy in applying. The culture is amazing &#45; u can start work anytime and leave anytime; just make sure you take responsibility and get the work done. Everyone is really kind and there are a plethora of opportunities to boost ur CV and apply your software experience in a professional environment. <br />The work they offer has marginal impact for your team (we&#39;re interns in a large company, so you have the opportunity to break stuff, but not too much). The people are friendly and listen to you; if you want to work on something else, just ask. <br />However, at times, I felt they left you to your own devices too much. This can be a bit daunting as it&#39;s typical to want regular feedback / guidance, but this is a sign that you&#39;re doing well and should continue your hard work. <br />The culture, people and pay at Roku makes it almost the dream job &#45; you get everything that you want (free food, standing desk, TVs all around you). However, my biggest concern is that you see the most brilliant minds working on something &#39;trivial&#39; such as TVs &#45; if that&#39;s your passion, then go for it, but if you have the ambition to see &#39;progress in humanity&#39;, and want to work on something ground breaking, then this may not be for you. Nevertheless, I still recommend you try out Roku, as the experience and knowledge you gain from working with specialists is a unique opportunity and can be the opportune stepping stone for your career.

They focus on the development of Wi&#45;Fi and Bluetooth technologies for a variety of devices. Their first&#45;rate connectivity IP can be found in a wide range of devices from mobiles through to IOT and everything in between.<br /><br />Working with Samsung Cambridge you will have the best of both worlds; a start&#45;up, fun and social culture nestled into a global company.  <br />Internships have been in the Architecture and Digital Design, Radio Firmware, Wi&#45;Fi Firmware, DevOps or Verification and Validation departments for 10 or 12 weeks.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 10 weeks paid over &#163;400 per week plus social events, free lunch, gym membership and Samsung staff store discount.<br />Internship at Samsung Cambridge was an absolutely wonderful ten weeks. There really is not much I&#39;d complain about if there were even anything to be unhappy about. During my time there, I build an autonomous firmware release tester from scratch and implemented it into the main framework of the company. It was particularly satisfying to see the work put in actually amount to something that will remain in use within the company long after my departure. Advice would be to apply to all places that may interest you, no such thing as over&#45;applying.<br /><br />IS student feedback: 12 weeks paid over &#163;350 per week plus leaving bonus, travel expenses, social events, free lunch, gym membership and Samsung staff store discount.<br />The summer internship I took for 12 weeks was a brilliant experience. An individual project was assigned to me which involved both software and hardware knowledge. I got to learn lots of new things and skills while working on the project. People around were always helpful and easy to ask for help whenever I got stuck.

	<td>Aviation data start&#45;up<br /><br />Satavia provides digital environmental awareness solutions. Aircraft exposure to environmental factors, including ice, dust, sulphur and volcanic ash, accelerates wear of engine and airframe components, and may pose a threat to flight safety. The combined process of aircraft inspection and overhaul is costly, but underpins the safety of flight. <br /><br />In 2016, sulphurous air pollution cost a single aircraft engine OEM 64 million pounds in unscheduled maintenance in the context of &#39;power&#45;by&#45;the&#45;hour&#39; maintenance services. Satavia&#39;s solution combines data from numerical weather prediction, Earth observation satellites, and live aircraft tracking to provide environmental exposure data products for individual aircraft. The core of the technology is a patent&#45;pending cloud&#45;based data analytics platform. The system architecture is technically scalable and utilises high performance computing (HPC) virtual environments. The company mission is to enable aircraft manufacturers, maintenance repair organisations and operators to minimise unscheduled aircraft maintenance caused by the environment, saving 100 milltions of pounds for the industry each year. <br /><br />Satavia is building a prototype platform and is engaged in a proof of concept pilot with a lead aircraft engine manufacturer customer. The company is at a critical phase of development seeking to maximise efficiency of data management, enabling large data holdings (including in situ observations, earth observation data and NWP data) to be integrated and cross&#45;queried, and build AI into the system capability. <br /><br />Location	s: Cambridge (or Harwell, Oxfordshire)

	<td>Sure Petcare is a pet lifestyle product specialist with a simple mission &#45; to develop smart pet products that improve the way we care for our pets.<br />The company was founded in 2008 by Cambridge physicist Dr Nick Hill, who wanted to stop intruder cats entering his home through the cat flap and terrorising his cat. He came up with a microchip&#45;operated cat flap that uses the cat&#39;s existing microchip as a personalised door key, preventing other animals from entering.<br />Through continuous innovation, the company has extended its range of smart pet products to include dog flaps, pet feeders, pet bowls and other accessories.  The company sells direct, through pet stores and veterinary practices across 15 countries.<br /><br />The company does offer great modern facilities located on an attractive business park, with a monthly company lunch and other adhoc events.

I spent 8 weeks working on a side project to a PhD student&#39;s research. I was in the targeted drug delivery stream, so was helping research a new delivery technique to deliver anti&#45;cancer drugs to brain tumours.  It was very independent (everyone was very lovely and happy to help! But they also expected you to crack on and set your own plans and goals). <br /><br />Over the summer, people tend to go on leave, so the lab was quite empty. <br /><br />Very very flexible hours and good pay. Great facilities and very hands on, I was in the lab everyd ay.<br /><br />Required a lot of thinking and independence! Definitely one of those &#39;you get out what you put in&#39; &#45; I had experience in python and writing test protocols and giving presentations so I found those bits easier so could take on more responsibility there.<br /><br />Would highly recommend, it was a lovely group and my PhD boss (Tobias) was wonderful. Very useful insight into what a career in academia would be like.<br /><br />IB student feedback: I worked with the Centre For Sustainable Road Freight (SRF) research group as a software engineering Intern for 11 weeks. I investigated available traffic data and wrote software to extract and manipulate this data into a useful form. This data will be used to tell lorry drivers when to coast in order to increase fuel efficiency &#45; with reduced braking and more consistent speeds. <br /><br />My personal aim for the internship was to help me decide whether I should pick the Information/ software modules in part IIA, as I enjoyed the lectures but was unsure if I would enjoy a &#39;real&#39; job in the field. The experience confirmed that I did and improved my programming and research skills greatly.<br /><br />The research group was highly supportive &#45; with points of contact at multiple levels from Phd students to weekly meetings with the head of the group. I can&#39;t recommend them highly enough to anyone in a similar position to me.<br /><br />IB student feedback: <br />Really interesting to discover the world of academia and feeling like I am already pushing the limits of modern technology despite only doing two years of the degree.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 		I enjoyed my UROP with CCRC Cambridge, working on methods of ice thickening in the Arctic. My project involved a lot of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics which built on material from the second year engineering tripos. I also valued getting experience in engineering research and being able to speak to experts in many fields related to my project.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 	I was working as part of a subteam in a huge project concerning carbon neutral flight. The first few weeks involved training and learning the methods, while the latter half of the internship was more working from my own initiative. In the first few weeks, it tookme a while to ask for help. I wish I had known it is totally normal to do so and it makes life easier for everyone : I completed my work earlier and could report to everyone else.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 6 week paid remote project. UROP placements can be fantastic opportunities to really get stuck into a topic and learn a lot about it in a short space of time. This was my second UROP and I (again) really enjoyed the self&#45;directed work style of the research projects, with most of my time being spent on tasks that I have decided need doing, and weekly meetings to update progress and discuss how to move forward. If you can find a project that really excites you I would highly recommend giving it a go. However the style of working may not gel with some people, and it is especially tough if you&#39;re not that keen on the subject matter. In short, fantastic if you can find something you really want to do, otherwise a more structured placement may be better.<br /><br />IB student feedback: Really interesting to discover the world of academia and feeling like I am already pushing the limits of modern technology despite only doing two years of the degree.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 	Really fun. We were thrown in at the deep end developing a model for zero emission aviation and researching future unlocks in the sector. It was at times very chalenging with no clear direction, as is the case with research, but we had a geat team aiding us and giving us advice throughout.<br /><br />Great project, very interesting and genuinely helpful. Good supervisor, easy to approach, helpful to talk to an genuinely friendly, although crazily busy academic life meant he was occasionally unable to properly support me and I ended up having nothing to do for periods of time.<br />A lot of practical, useful engineering.<br /><br />The internship allowed me to have a better understanding of how engineering and any course content is incorporated in the industrial context and has pushed me into feeling more confident with taking up responsibilities when it comes to design decisions.<br />I learnt a lot of CAD skills.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 10 weeks paid in the Department of Physics. Working on a project exposed me to experts from a range of fields which served as an important platform to build research connection.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 10 weeks paid in the Department of Physics. I stumbled upon this opportunity through the UROP database. The internship was a very enriching experience, as I actually helped contributed to scientific research. I would recommend anyone planning to work here to have a good working knowledge of Matlab, as a lot of the work involves scripting in Matlab.<br /><br />IB student. 10 weeks paid in the Department of Engineering. It was a good opportunity to work alongside world experts in a field that I am interested in and wish to establish career in. The work could sometimes be very demanding and overtime was necessary to accomplish the task at hand. Since the work was very demanding, working too much could mean that one does not have enough time to rest and recover for the new academic year.<br /><br />For more information click on the SPECIFIC VACANCY DETAILS link (green tick to the left).

	<td>Amgen Scholars at the University of Cambridge participate in eight weeks of intensive research in the sciences. Each student will join the laboratory of one of Cambridge&#39;s experienced faculty members, including some of the world&#39;s top academic scientists, gaining hands&#45;on lab experience and contributing to the advancement of science. Students will have the opportunity to attend seminars, journal clubs, and other networking activities; and to experience the excitement of working in one of the world&#39;s foremost universities, surrounded by enthusiastic and motivated academics, graduate students and postdoctoral workers. During the programme, scholars will present their emerging findings in laboratory groups, to their supervisors and make an oral presentation to their peers. There will also be the opportunity to present a poster at the end of programme symposium hosted in Cambridge which Amgen Scholars from across Europe will attend.<br /><br />Cambridge welcomes applications from undergraduates from across Europe and prides itself in providing the world&#39;s highest&#45;quality university education for the brightest and best, regardless of background. Interested students from across Europe are invited to visit the Program website for further details and where they can use the University of Cambridge Research Topics Database to find projects and supervisors that they might be interested in.<br /><br />STUDENT FEEDBACK<br />It&#39;s mostly only ETH which do placements more typically relevant to engineers<br />Very useful experience if considering a career in academia there were placements available there in computer vision, medical Imaging, machine learning etc with a biological slant so definitely worth info engineers applying (i.e. don&#39;t be scared by the fact that on the face of it it seems like an internship for biologists)

	<td>In 2004, a team of innovative engineers and designers set themselves the challenge to design a solar water heating system for the mainstream. Viridian sought partners from the building industry to help with the definition and specification of the product and quicky realised that cost wasn&#39;t the only thing holding back solar from mainstream acceptance. Aesthetics, durability and ease of installation were just as important. The result of the collaboration with developers, construction companies, and other building professionals is a product that transforms the attractiveness of this type of renewable energy.<br /><br />Launched in 2007, the Clearline range of solar water heating panels has helped Viridian Solar become established as a leading solar water heating supplier in the UK.<br /><br /><br />STUDENT FEEDBACK<br />Viridian Solar was a great placement for me. I had a great time planning and researching how to build the test rig, and building the rig itself. <br />I was quite surprised at first that he wanted me to build it all nearly by myself, but it&#39;s very rewarding seeing something you built yourself take shape. Everyone at the company were very welcoming and inviting. To be honest, I think I had a lucky break with the placement, since I doubt anyone else had this much of a hands&#45;on, fun, building placement. I&#39;d <br />very much recommend this placement to any future undergraduate.

	<td>VividQ is leading the visual revolution of AR gaming. Its innovative holographic technology enables hardware manufacturers, game developers and content creators to build immersive AR experiences that players won&#39;t want to leave.<br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: A	Absolutely amazing experience. Everyone in the office is extremely nice and helpful. The work culture is very relaxed and facilitates learning since you can freely ask anyone to explain things to you without fear of judgement. Gave me autonomy to complete my tasks as I wanted and treated me with respect as a proper employee and not just an intern. Made sure I was enjoying the work assigned and changed it when I said I didn&#39;t. Multiple social events (escape rooms, climbing, dinners, free F1 tickets!!). No complaints at all.
