They have, in the Bristol Robotics Lab, an advanced hardware setup called the RoboFab, developed within the recently completed EPSRC Autonomous Robot Evolution project, that is uniquely able to 3D print and assemble complete evolved robots. See this YouTube video with an intro and video footage of an early version of the RoboFab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpUSltZg6z4 <br /><br />The aim of your project would be to work on the RoboFab to explore the morphology space, first evolving (in simulation) then fabricating, and then experimentally testing the new robots.<br /><br />The placement would be suitable for a student interested in conducting experiments in evolving and then testing real robots. Ideally you will have some experience of experimental robotics, as well as coding and Linux.<br /><br />They are unable to offer a salary or bursary for the placement. However, you will benefit from working in the UK&#39;s largest robotics research lab https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/, with an opportunity to find out about the very wide range of research in the lab while sharing ideas with the lab&#39;s community of faculty and students.<br /><br />Had a CUED student last summer.

	<td>Cobham is an engineering (aerospace) company. Each site has its own technologies, products and programmes. Wimborne focuses on Air To Air Refuelling.<br /><br />Engineering and programmes based placements are available. Students will gain experience of a busy engineering site and working alongside technical specialists. They will be hands on and hopefully use new software packages (subject to the placement).<br /><br />Ideally suited to 2nd or 3rd year students as the student will be involved in key tasks alongside the rest of the team.  The placement can be between 8 to 12 weeks.<br /><br />Student Feedback:<br />IA:  I undertook a placement at Cobham in Wimborne. The site I was located focused on Air&#45;to&#45;Air refuelling and Weapon Carriage and Release systems. I was in the Avionics team of the R&D department. My project involved the design and implementation of a system that could wirelessly transmit data through a series of interfaces. All the staff was very helpful and welcoming. This internship assisted me in narrowing down the options of engineering I would like to specialize in.  Cobham is considered a great company in Aerospace Engineering and is a good first choice if you are intersted in this industry or in Automotive.<br /><br />IA feedback. 11 weeks paid over &#163;250 per week.<br />I learned a lot in my placements with Cobham Mission Systems in the Simulation and Modelling team, consisting of around 10 people in my team but over 700 office workers on site. I tried out different roles/tasks for the first 1.5 weeks until I settled down with a Matlab App project. Never used<br />Matlab (not even during Lego Mindstorm), but learned everything as I made the app. Working hours were very flexible as long as you get 37 hours a week. Pay was &#163;15,500 or about &#163;300 a week. You get a lot of freedom on the job, and colleagues were more than happy to help me especially<br />graduates who were in my situation just a few years ago. <br /><br />IA feedback: 8 weeks paid over &#163;250 per week.<br />Good bits: Everyone was helpful.<br />Bad bits: Procurement and time delays with procedures.

They work hard to continually update their products and ensure that their R&D is cutting edge.<br /><br /><br /><br />STUDENT FEEDBACK 2018: It was absolutely amazing! Great company and great people, and I was really well supported.  I would definitely recommend this company. It was small of course, which meant that I really got to hear about all the sides of the business and got to know everyone. I was given worthwhile projects, and received lots of support and encouragement from many different people. Despite their small size, they were an exciting company to work for because they were fast growing, and were in my opinion, doing some awesome things!<br /><br />At the start,  it took a week or so for things to start making sense, and of course there were dull days from time to time but I found that my weeks were generally speaking getting better and better.

Intuitive design and innovation sit alongside a traditional approach to building relationships and providing a service that delivers real value, both in undertaking our own work and within the finished product.<br /><br />As we believe that engineering as a passion can be installed in someone from an early age, we actively encourage work experience students to spend time with the team to give them an insight into the industry and what it means to be an Engineer or a Technician and the ways in which this can be achieve. Students that come to us will be provided with challenging tasks to test their ability and encourage a good work ethic which can be taken forward for the rest of their careers.

They explain to us how the company works, the backgrounds and the general guidance that an employee should comply with in an interesting and interactive way. These solve a lot of confusion and allow a smooth start for all the new comers. Secondly, from the many COVID protection measures and the employee benefits that were put in place, I can feel that the company cares about its employees well being. The free lunch and drink really enhances my experience in Dyson. <br />In terms of the programme, my manager and mentor gave me a lot of freedom so that I can explore and design by myself, but also provide me with plenty of guidance and help whenever I got stuck. I always feel supported and encouraged, which boost my confidence in electrical engineering design. The program allows me to bridge the gap between electrical theory and the real life practical applications.<br /><br /><br />Inside Dyson Spotlight Sessions &#45; an opportunity for students and graduates to meet with us and find out what it&#39;s really like to work at Dyson!

	<td>Frazer&#45;Nash is a leading systems and engineering technology company.<br /><br />You&#39;ll work on live projects alongside experienced engineers, contributing as much to their business as you learn from it. If you have the opportunity to work for them over two summer they can consider you coming back, staying in the same team or working in another area to broaden your knowledge.<br /><br />IB student feedback: Sent off a CV and their application form in November and was given an interview early on in Lent term.  Interview was an hour long with some technical questions (along with a general discussion of my experiences and why I had applied etc).  At the end of the interview they asked about which team I wanted to be put in and which office so they could try and organise people as conveniently as possible.<br /><br />Once the placement was secured there was a HUGE number of forms to fill in as due to the nature of some of the clients they work for (MOD etc), they require very tight security!<br /><br />I was put in the software team, they were clearly well prepared for interns.  I was given a project to work on for the duration of the placement, which gave me a constant supply of things to do (often not the case in internships!).  Everyone was absolutely fine with my limited prior knowledge of how to code and gave me a huge amount of help and I got much more confident during the placement.  This was the most valuable aspect of the placement to me.<br /><br />There were various meetings of different sizes in which I got to present the that I was working and other projects on from the university course to different teams of people, meaning I had to be confident with public speaking!<br /><br />They also ran a bit of a design workshop with all the other interns in the Dorking office (8 in total, but all in different teams), which gave me a much better idea of the other side of being an engineering consultant, ie considering the overall problem, developing the requirements of a solution and then coming up with a range of different solutions to present to a client.  This was a useful insight into part of what being an engineering consultant means&#45; one of the other interns had spent their placement doing this type of thing.

Each member of our team is trained in electrical and mechanical engineering, environmental design and building physics. This training takes place in&#45;house, creating an integrated understanding that considers the whole building. We deliver buildings that work, with a focus on detail and finish, to ensure our engineering serves the architecture. It&#39;s the way Max trained his team and it&#39;s an approach that has endured.<br />For over 50 years we&#39;ve been pioneers in sustainable, low energy and low carbon building design. At the heart of our partnership is a desire to tackle the climate and biodiversity emergency our world is facing. We have created the Net Zero Carbon Guide, a free and open resource, to help the industry navigate the process of achieving net zero carbon for both old and new buildings. You can read more at netzerocarbonguide.co.uk.<br /><br />Office locations: Cambridge, London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Bristol.<br /><br />There is a lot of competition to work at Max Fordham.  If you are genuinely interested in the Practice, and you have the relevant skills and are preferably in their third or fourth year, then you can apply to  jobs@maxfordham.com, including a chatty letter, telling them why they would like a summer placement and state which of the offices you would prefer to apply to.

	<td>Recycling Technologies is changing the story of plastics by enabling more plastic waste to be recycled into valuable resources, thereby keeping plastics in the circular economy and out of our oceans.  They have developed a modular machine RT7000 to chemically recycle plastic waste back into a valuable petroleum raw material, for use as a feedstock in new plastics production, waxes and fuels. Using a chemical approach to recycling, no plastic gets left behind. Using a modular approach to process design, they harness the power of mass production to scale up quickly and cost effectively. <br /><br />1A student feedback: 8 weeks paid over &#163;350 per week plus social events. <br />Company&#39;s activities concentrate in design, manufacturing and testing plastic pyrolysis units of different capacities. The company is willing to accommodate your needs &#45; they would ask about your preferences during the interview. I worked in the R&D department that required some knowledge in the fields of Chemistry, Engineering and Chemical Engineering. It was similar in many instances to the lab work at the university because the main scope was to get to know why and how something works rather than simply making it work. But that differs in a different  department. Overall I feel I had the opportunity to do come up with the solutions that the team will be using for a long time. On the other hand, sometimes I was not given a sufficient number of tasks and I was a bit bored. I feel it was a good internship that will help me with my application for the summer internship during the next holidays.

Specific to each area I was introduced to, I was given initial instructions before embarking on my own testing, validating and reviewing of certain products Renishaw produces, from its laser encoders and units to its packing software and fibre production. At the end of each review, I would write up my findings, conclusions and solutions that could progress the continual model of innovation the company believes in. Not only was I introduced to continual project work, I was thrown into the proactive side of the process improvement role and shadowed experienced engineers on solving problems under time pressure. From the time spent there, I learnt a lot of information on precision electrical and manufacturing production and a different side to engineering I had not previously been as aware of. The proactive nature of responses to production failure and small increases to existing solutions to up efficiencies I had not considered. This was different compared to the more stereotypical, unique, holistic, solution driven engineering that I previously saw as engineering. In addition, I observed much about the inner workings of a large engineering firm and its management systems. Seeing the factory floor teams communicate so effectively to the upper technicians and management made me appreciate the necessity of teamwork and clear communication especially after watching the consequences when this was not the case.

I was in the encoders devision and worked on 2 main projects. firstly, a 6 axis mount to test installation tolerances for a new product which envolved CAD as well as ordering many thousands of pounds of kit to put a final jig together. Secondly, I made a Monte Carlo simulation to track how build tolerances interact in the final product. This was done in MATLAB. Overall 2 worthwhile and enjoyable projects where I was well suported throughout and made to feel welcome amongst the team.<br /><br />The two downsides I can think of are that finding accomodation was very hard as nowhere wanted to do anything less than 6 months and you basically need to be able to drive to the main site as it is in the middle of nowhere with few transport links.<br /><br />IA STUDENT FEEDBACK 2018: Big company, many departments, nice to feel a part of it, lots of workers at their main site (including other summer interns/industrial placements)<br />The area&#39;s beautiful (at least in the summer).<br />I was pretty much paid minimum wage, and didn&#39;t do extremely technical jobs.<br />A week spent being trained on their Equator product was interesting (this was relevant to my work, which was around the Equator 300).<br />Technically, the metrology of their products functions on a microscopic scale, so you have to think carefully about many factors (i.e. temperature, the material being displaced by the probe)&#45; measurements on that level is fairly complex.<br />I wish I had made a conscious decision to take time off in the evenings &#45; working days are oddly tiring, and the pressure to get a lot done after work made me slightly less committed during the day.<br /><br />Work<br />I was given an engaging task and a fair amount of freedom within it.

	<td>Reventec is a dynamic and ambitious sensing technology company that supplies level, position, and flow sensors to every single Formula 1 team on the grid. They are also privileged to supply product into the rest of the world&#39;s premier motorsport series: Indycar, NASCAR, DTM, WEC to name just a few. They are active in other markets, but motorsport makes up around 70% of our core business.<br /><br />Sister company Sentronics is under the same roof and is involved in ultrasonic flow measurement of liquids (fuels and coolants) in automotive and motorsport applications. <br /><br />Currently there are 11 full&#45;time employees supported by some external consultants; one Director and one consultant are CUED alumni and both will be closely involved with the placement. Both companies are growing &#45; permanent graduate recruitment is therefore very much a possibility.<br /><br />They design, develop and manufacture their own electro&#45;mechanical sensors, as well as carrying out some contract R&D work; this includes development of the electronics, firmware, software and mechanical designs. All placement work will be on currently active projects and will result in exposure to a range of engineering disciplines (electronics, mechanical, software, control and instrumentation, test, R&D, application engineering, and prototyping and low volume manufacturing); this might be useful to a student who hasn&#39;t quite decided which engineering field to specialise in yet and is also particularly attractive to someone wishing to go on to work in a multi&#45;disciplinary R&D environment. <br /><br />Applications are welcome from students who have already completed at least Part IA. They would be open to discussing ideas for Part IIB projects with a successful placement student.<br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: All of the employees at Reventec were extremely friendly to me and always worked hard to make sure I knew what I was doing and that I did actually have things to do. The work environment was quite casual, with conversations between colleagues being very common&#45;place. There is definitely strong interest in motorsports within the company&#39;s staff, with the company&#39;s main products being sensors for some of the biggest motorsports series in the world. If you too have this as an interest, you will already be off to good start with them! <br /><br />The only thing I could say is that you will most likely pick up less hard skills from this internship than if you did one with a larger company that has a fully structured internship program. That being said, as long as you are prepared to dive into their projects and think and research for yourself, this would be a very good experience, especially if you are considering R&D as a potential future career path.

They are active in other markets, but motorsport makes up around 70% of our core business.<br /><br />Sister company Sentronics is under the same roof and is involved in ultrasonic flow measurement of liquids (fuels and coolants) in automotive and motorsport applications. <br /><br />Currently there are 11 full&#45;time employees supported by some external consultants; one Director and one consultant are CUED alumni and both will be closely involved with the placement. Both companies are growing &#45; permanent graduate recruitment is therefore very much a possibility.<br /><br />They design, develop and manufacture their own electro&#45;mechanical sensors, as well as carrying out some contract R&D work; this includes development of the electronics, firmware, software and mechanical designs. All placement work will be on currently active projects and will result in exposure to a range of engineering disciplines (electronics, mechanical, software, control and instrumentation, test, R&D, application engineering, and prototyping and low volume manufacturing); this might be useful to a student who hasn&#39;t quite decided which engineering field to specialise in yet and is also particularly attractive to someone wishing to go on to work in a multi&#45;disciplinary R&D environment.

Independent working will be encouraged but, mentoring and technical support will be offered.<br /><br />They offer a placement of approximately 12 weeks over the summer vacation (flexible start and finish dates). <br /><br />They are primarily involved in the design and supply of mixed analogue and digital integrated circuits and MEMS devices. They would expect candidates to have an interest in the possibility of a career in these fields.

There were a few less interesting days where it fell on the intern to test small batches of new/ sample products, but this kind of work was infrequent. One potential downside is the location, Ilfracombe is quite small and there are not that many things to do. I got around this by only being there 4 nights a week, however its something to think about if you prefer places where there is always something to do.
