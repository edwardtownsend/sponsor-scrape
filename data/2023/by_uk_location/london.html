As a field engineer at Bechtel, you&#39;ll have the opportunity to work in flexible roles in the office, on site or a mixture of both. <br /><br />FEEDBACK FROM STUDENT. 1st year student. Excellent experience. Challenging, real tasks on data analysis, visualisation, reporting and programming as part of the Crossrail programme. Friendly team, ready to offer support. Competitive salary. Bechtel has various construction projects around the world so other locations could be available. Although it is a construction company, it offers internships on Management, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, as well as Civil Engineering.  Salary: 400&#45;450 per week and meal discounts at nearby restaurants.<br /><br />IIA stuent feedback: 4 week paid remote internship. The virtual internship ran smoothly. They prepared personalised short tasks for everybody. Unfortunately the internship was shortened from 10 weeks to 4, therefore it was hard to do something meaningful. I definitely learned a lot about the company and the life at Bechtel.

	<td>Bluemethane turns off the world&#39;s methane emissions tap by capturing methane from water to prevent its escape to the atmosphere, in turn creating a new source of bioenergy. Bluemethane is developing technologies to monitor and capture methane emissions from water, as a new source of data, power and revenue. This will permanently remove methane from water, reduce global warming and support the energy transition. They&#39;re starting with hydropower plants and then scaling to non&#45;hydropower reservoirs, water treatment, rice cultivation, other industries, and ultimately, natural bodies of water.<br /><br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: 	&#39;My internship at bluemethane was well worth the effort. My main job was to read through lots of academic papers and do general research, exploring what technologies exist for the company to achieve its methane&#45;capturing goals. Working alongside another intern, we then evaluated the technologies we discovered based on technological, financial, environmental, and social criteria, to find the most suitable ones for the company&#39;s purposes. Given that the company was very young at the time of my internship, I believe that my work had a real impact on the company&#39;s future trajectory. <br /><br />The best aspects of the internship were my friendly, enthusiastic bosses (Nestor and Louise) who were always happy to offer help, insight and advice; and working alongside other interns who were university students like me. I gained lots of knowledge concerning methane emissions and hydropower; it was truly interesting to discover what technologies are out there for monitoring & preventing methane formation and for capturing & using methane.<br /><br />The most difficult part of this internship was working remotely, because it was somewhat demotivating <br /><br />Overall, I would recommend an internship at bluemethane for anyone looking to join the fight against global warming by contributing to the work of an ambitious climate start&#45;up.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 		My internship was split mostly in two parts: market research, to determine if there was space in the market for the company&#39;s technology, and then adaptation of the technology to the specific market opportunties. The working pattern was completely flexible, and many colleagues were based in different time zones. Remote internship.

	<td>Burns & McDonnell are a full&#45;service engineering, architecture, construction, environmental and consulting solutions firm and they plan, design, permit, construct and manage facilities globally.<br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: Between my second and third year of engineering, I embarked on a ten&#45;week internship at Burns & McDonnell, an employee&#45;owned engineering and architecture firm headquartered in the States. Their industry&#45;leading team of engineers and architects welcomed me to their new consultancy near Liverpool Street Station, London, where they undertake the design of hyperscale data centres for international clients. Having covered general engineering fundamentals in my first two years of study, interning with a multidisciplinary team provided a valuable opportunity for me to make an informed decision on my specialism by the end of the internship. Given that Burns & McDonnell have only recently expanded to the UK, I was their first intern in London. Nevertheless a well&#45;established internship program in the United States, with hundreds of interns per year, provided a solid framework for an engaging and enjoyable internship experience.<br />Over the ten&#45;week placement, I worked on two different data centre projects where my role was to support the mechanical and electrical teams by completing deliverables to be submitted to the client. This included carrying out important design work involving producing detailed drawings and schematics of many subsystems required for the uninterrupted operation of mission critical IT infrastructure in a data centre. Unlike in traditional building services engineering, masses of critical equipment and services must be coordinated in a limited space, requiring creative solutions to route ductwork, pipes, cable containment and busbars throughout the building. Coordinating these systems is a complex problem addressed by using BIM software in which a unified 3D model of the data centre can be worked on by the different disciplines concurrently. <br />We used Autodesk Revit (the industry standard) which unified the architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, telecoms, fire&#45;safety and security elements of the data centre model.<br /> <br />My responsibilities on the mechanical team were as follows: to design, route and size the HVAC system for office and admin rooms; to perform pressure drop and heat transmission calculations to size rooftop units (RTUs) for the HVAC system; to streamline existing workflows through excel automation and python scripts and produce a template for heat transmission calculations for time savings on future projects. These activities required me to think creatively and independently in making certain design choices. On the electrical side, my responsibilities included the following: to perform a short circuit analysis on the medium voltage, house and critical systems; to produce earthing and lightning protection schematics and drawings; to produce per room lighting control strategy drawings; to produce cable containment and busbar routing detail sections; to perform cable sizing calculations which were summarised in a schedule, and finally to route small power and lighting, fire alarm and earthing cable containment throughout the building. For both disciplines, I found that my course knowledge was useful in providing a basic understanding of concepts, though knowledge only takes you so far before you need to rely on innate engineering critical thinking.<br /><br />The team is close&#45;knit (26 members and counting) and great fun to work and spend time with &#45; I enjoyed getting lunch with my colleagues from Spitalfields market and going to the pub after work. Every so often we attended CPD seminars and had free lunch with manufacturers in the city which was always welcome.  I&#39;m grateful to have worked with such an inspiring and friendly group of people. <br />The experience was a valuable opportunity to get a taste of data centre engineering and the work was always engaging and a welcome challenge. Interning at Burns & McDonnell has been a great experience and I am looking forward to returning next year.

	<td>Co&#45;founded in 2019 by entrepreneurs Archie Watts&#45;Farmer, Francis Lempp and Nadiur Rahman, Carnot is developing game&#45;changing power units with twice the efficiency, half the fuel consumption & zero CO2 emissions. Currently large/long&#45;haul applications, responsible for 50% of global transport CO2 emissions, have no alternatives to diesel engines. For 130 years, engines have wasted a third of fuel energy to cooling systems. Carnot has eliminated this wasted energy by re&#45;thinking, re&#45;designing and revolutionising the internal combustion engine to bring it into the 21st Century.

	<td>POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILLED FOR SUMMER 2023<br /><br />CCell build protective reefs along coastlines that reduce wave intensity, reversing the effects of climate change that have put beach&#45;front properties and communities at risk.<br /><br />From their main base in the Finsbury park, north London (N4 3JH), they design, manufacture and test system components, including manufacture of power electronics, electrochemistry and material science. The company also develops a range of advanced numerical models to simulate wave&#45;structure interactions, coastal morphology, extreme hurricane loads, structure design, composite design and electrochemistry.<br /><br />The company has the potential to take on two students to assist with research and development. Their roles can either be focussed towards physical product development, e.g. electronics, sensing and electrochemistry; or support the core development of modelling tools and intuitive web&#45;interfaces; or a blend of both.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: 9 weeks paid. My internship was remote and was programming related. I was assigned an open source shoreline modelling program written in Matlab and my task was to fully translate it to C++ from scratch. Aside from pure translation, I also wrote a large amount of unit testing and accompanied function documentation written in Doxygen.

In the UK we have approximately 15,000 employees. We are the UK&#39;s leading generator and supplier of low carbon energy. We produce about one&#45;Fifth of the nation&#39;s electricity from our nuclear, coal and gas power stations, wind farms, and combined heat and power plants. We have a focus on safe, dependable energy generation and an ethos of service excellence. We intend to play a leading role in new nuclear build in the UK and secure a �bright� future for the combined business and its employees.<br /><br />At a power station, you could expect to take on a junior hands&#45;on role: perhaps developing your fault&#45;finding skills; project managing minor projects; supporting safety at work; examining feasibility cases to extend stations&#39; lifetimes; or carrying out maintenance and installing new equipment. Because our power stations are often big local employers, you&#39;ll find there�s a real sense of pride and a close community in each one.<br /><br />Alternatively, at Barnwood or East Kilbride, you could be involved in a project to support our nuclear power stations, again taking a role as part of a team. Because these offices are where our teams tackle design engineering, lifetime planning for the reactors, outages and large projects, you&#39;ll find yourself surrounded by highly qualified professionals, taking a broader, more strategic view.<br /><br />We have high expectations for the students we take on: we&#39;re looking for people at any stage of their university education who are genuinely interested in nuclear energy, and who want to take ownership of their experience on the placement.

Remote based internship for 6 weeks paid up to &#163;300 per week. 		The first week was mostly research based, looking into the established methods for the project I was working on. After that, I worked with programming robot toolpaths for parametric construction for the remaining time (a further 5 weeks). I enjoyed working on projects where I could work out my own solutions, but the lack of regular contact was obviously a difficulty in some cases.

	<td>We are a London&#45;based early&#45;stage B2B SaaS start&#45;up shaping the future of work. Our product focuses on helping large organizations to successfully operate and scale a digital workforce. Given the accelerating demographic change in many parts of the world, digitizing parts of the workforce is becoming a real necessity for companies in all sorts of industries to survive. <br /><br />Today, countless organizations struggle to scale robotic process automation (RPA) due to painful operational challenges. The inherent brittleness of digital robots presents a serious distraction to developers, lowering the speed at which the automation layer can be scaled and improved. To address this, Hivedive provides vendor agnostic RPA operations software, enabling enterprises to realize the true benefits of a scaled automation landscape. We empower developers by providing a single source of truth across vendors and other RPA technologies, allowing for a completely new perspective on the automation landscape. Making it easy to control a constantly evolving environment, our software helps enterprises to turn technical debt into a true asset.<br /><br />We always love to connect with engineering talent and so it will not be an issue if somebody applied for a different time period, we are quite flexible.

If you are keen to approach a particular member of staff (so long as they do not appear on the list of non&#45;participating staff), you are free to submit a considered request to them.

	<td>KwickScreen is at the forefront of infection control in Healthcare. They are a team of Designers & Engineers who have spent the last 12 years working tirelessly alongside the NHS. Their award&#45;winning portable, retractable hospital screens create safe space for patients everyday. Michael Korn, the founder is ex&#45;CUED.<br /><br />They are looking for bright, talented and passionate interns to join the R&D team. They are flexible with internship length, as well as with the internship start and end dates &#45; please just get in touch!<br /><br />For the length of your internship with them you will be part of the R&D team and you will be given real work and meaningful tasks from day one. Under the guidance of the more senior R&D team members you will help them find creative approaches to the current problems they are working on. You will leave the internship having developed new skills and contributed to the current design and engineering projects they are working on within the team.<br /><br />Have taken students for the last 4 years.<br /><br />IIA: Great, dynamic company. Lots of hands on work and responsibility given to interns. Most employees recently graduated so lots of young faces. One week remote, eight weeks in person. Would encourage people looking for a mechanical and / or electrical internship to apply.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 6 weeks remote with visits to their office. A small startup which is fast&#45;paced has a team of lovely people! You might be assigned to work on pre&#45;existing projects or brainstorm ideas for something completely new. Lots of rapid prototyping where you work on an idea for a week, build a prototype and present/review it at the end of the week. Think there might be client visits as well but that didn&#39;t happen this year due to covid. You have lots of flexibility with what you get involved in (cad, builds, grant writing, testing) depending on what you can offer. Pros: small friendly team that are very willing to teach you the practical things, you get a good idea of how a start up works, not much technical knowledge needed so you can get really involved with the projects. Cons: everyone is so busy so things are arranged last minute and communication isn&#39;t great, you get to apply lots of things learnt from MET / management but not much else from part 1, in a bit of an awkward location.<br /><br />IB student feedback 2018: The internship is incredibly hands&#45;on and practical &#45; do not apply here if you wish to spend your summer sitting at a desk. As it is a small company, you are involved in almost all of its activities: one day you are working on a major design project; the next you&#39;re helping out on the production line; the next you&#39;re asked your opinion on business expansion plans; the next you&#39;re building new furniture for the office. As an intern, you are valued and given responsibility and variation, although as a result you spend less time on more technical engineering aspects than you would at a larger (or more software based) company.

Members of the company are extremely helpful in explaining and advising. The company is located in the centre of London which is convenient. I was also given several training sessions which I found really helpful. My supervisor in also tries to make sure that us as interns, can maximise our experience. All in all, Leapian is a very exciting and warm&#45;hearted place to work in.<br /><br />IA student 2018: I had a wonderful experience working for Leapian.

	<td>Longevity Partners is a multi&#45;disciplinary energy and sustainability consultancy and investment business. It was established in 2015 to support the transition to a low carbon economy in the UK, Europe and worldwide. They provide advice and investment in order to lower cost and generate sustainable profits.<br /><br />They offer one internship for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week with 9&#45;6PM working hours (1 hour lunch break). <br /><br />The intern will be required to be fluent in Dutch to help work with their clients based in the Netherlands and will be managed by one of their consultants/analysts. The Internship will likely consist of 2&#45;3 projects over the time period. <br /><br />Their company delivers consultancy and advisory services for ESG in the built environment so projects may consist of assisting on Building&#45;level Sustainability Audits for both In&#45;Use buildings and new developments. This could require review of building operational documentation, policies, data &#45; such as consumption data, review of design and specification plans, calculating carbon footprints, some energy and insulation calculations. They may also be involved in policy and reporting projects where data analysis is required and alignment to policy targets. <br /><br />They try and keep the internship varied to provide students with exposure to sustainability both in practical engineering terms and with regards to the market, policies, stakeholders and the real estate industry as a whole. <br /><br />IA student feedback: 12 weeks paid remote internship.  Got to work on a variety of different projects and with lots of teams. Love how international and friendly the office is, really felt included even if the whole internship was virtual.<br /><br />IB student feedback: The company fist and foremost were extremely welcoming, I was able to make a lot of connections, met almost everyone in the company and even made some friends amongst the other interns and some of my colleagues. Everyone was very approachable, which made making the most out of my time there very easy, as help was always on hand almost immediately. This extends to the CEO who was often in and around the office and was very keen to get to know you as a person not just as an employee. The company are extremely keen for anyone who is multilingual, or would have working proficiency in more than one language. <br /><br />I mainly worked on BREEAM In Use (Sustainable building certification) under many different project managers. I answered questions in the assessment and wrote assessment comments based on photographic and document evidence for assets located primarily in Italy, however also in France, Sweden, Spain and the UK. The final assessment I saw through entirely to submission onto the assessment portal. This was great as I knew that the work I was doing was valuable and I felt trusted by working on similar things to the permanent employees. <br /><br />Due to my internship being only 8 weeks I felt slightly constrained in this one certification (it was monotonous at times but I feel that I know it extremely well now), however had I had longer with them there would have been more opportunity to branch out to other assessments the company use. <br /><br />Alongside the day&#45;to&#45;day project work there were opportunities to look at other aspects of the company including helping with some Climate Resilience work (I found this fascinating) and attending some Webinars on Circular Economy on behalf of the business development team and reported back. Furthermore, another intern (also just finished Part IB like myself) and I had the chance to do a presentation on a topic of our choosing, with invitations sent out to the whole company. We chose &#39;Tokyo 2020: Sustainability Success or Greenwashing Garbage&#39; and this was truly a highlight to be able to have a discussion with our colleagues whilst teaching them something new.<br /><br />My most valuable lessons from this were just the introduction into the world of work, the expectations on me as an employee as well as how to build meaningful connections/make the most out of an experience. Also, I learned that there are so many more different types of jobs/roles out there than I ever realised, and the horizon is so broad! Definitely excited to see what I find next.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 12 weeks paid remote internship.  This internship was a very valuable experience, although it does not really help with the edcational part of our course it did help give me lots of new skills. I have left the internship feeling extremely competant at my job and able to apply for similar jobs.<br />IA student feedback: 9 weeks paid over &#163;350 per week and had social events.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 12 weeks paid over &#163;350. Remote internship, so was working from home. This internship was a very valuable experience, although it does not really help with the edcational part of our course it did help give me lots of new skills. I have left the internship feeling extremely competant at my job and able to apply for similar jobs.

	<td>MachineMax is a global company helping off&#45;highway heavy equipment users to maximise the productivity and profitability of every machine in their fleet.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 3 weeks paid over &#163;250 per week also social events (Secret Santa, chatting over lunch with my co&#45;workers, a co&#45;worker&#39;s birthday celebration in the office, one free lunch out to Wagamama when a new co&#45;worker joined) and one day out in the field: my first visit to a construction site and, for which, my travel expenses were covered. I also got a gift card from the company, and my supervisor lent me a book on software design. <br />I had an overall really good experience. The people were really nice, and the company&#39;s work was interesting. I particularly liked the feel of it being a start&#45;up since the relatively small team meant it didn&#39;t feel corporate. The small team also meant that I was able to contribute more than I would have in a larger company, as I was able to freely discuss with the lead engineers without feeling like I was undervalued and dismissed as an &#39;intern&#39;. I was also given catalogued tasks to complete and feedback on in the team&#39;s daily &#39;stand&#45;up&#39; meetings. The office building in Canary Wharf was intimidating at first but then I realised I didn&#39;t have to dress in office wear and could wear my regular clothes, as most people at the company did. This made me feel so much more at ease and I didn&#39;t feel as if I didn&#39;t belong in such a high&#45;end environment. <br />The view of the London skyline was particularly amazing from the 15th floor! Canary Wharf is generally a beautiful place since the trees outside our office building were decorated with Christmas lights and there is a large bit of water really close&#45;by. The surrounding shops and buildings also look so glamorous. Occasionally, I went to the massive food court/shopping mall below the building, underground, where there were at least a hundred different places to eat/shop and so much variety! There was also a canteen a few floors below our office which is where I usually went for lunch, since it was less expensive. There was also a prayer/relaxation room on the same floor as the canteen, with wudhu facilities so I felt incredibly comfortable.<br />However, there were a few negatives; towards the end of internship I was unable to get help for the work I was doing, since the co&#45;workers who would usually be able to help me were either working from home or on holiday, and this made it extremely difficult to progress and complete my tasks. I was also left to independently complete some tasks and, while I enjoyed the ability to focus on what I needed to do myself, it was difficult to progress when I had little/no experience in what I was being asked to do. This was quite frustrating as I felt as if I was aimlessly googling different topics and found it hard to find the answer.

The nature of a start&#45;up allowed for involved, interesting and open&#45;ended work. Tasks varied from assisting engineers in the test facility to conducting own projects on cart dynamic stability &#45; a derailment project comprised most of the 9 weeks. The project involved using Solidworks, Arduino microelectronics, C++, Python, MQTT data transmission software and mechanical implementation. The flexible working was a great benefit, allowing home&#45;working and several days paid holiday.

Good Bits: Given loads of responsibility, colleagues were really welcoming, work was generally interesting, I was able to work on the areas I found more interesting. Work was often challenging. 35 hour working week also felt like a low work&#45;load compared to Cambridge timetable. Never expected to work weekends. It&#39;s also paid which is great. <br />The company also has a very cool airfield that houses their testing facilities and a hanger full of aircraft (incl. two Meteors) which I got to visit.  <br /><br />Bad Bits: I got lucky and was in the systems department. From what I gathered, some other interns had to do much less interesting work. So it definitely depends quite a lot on which team you&#39;re in.

This division was previously a company called MetaSwitch and was acquired by Microsoft in 2020. The division pretty much operates in a pre&#45;acquisition way and the works that you will be assigned may differ from what you would expect from a cloud computing technology company. The office in Enfield is new and nice. Many employees in the division have been working in MetaSwitch for more than 20 years. They are professional and are always open for help. You will have your mentor for daily help. There are lunch time sports sessions as well.

	<td>Orthonika is a spin&#45;out company from Imperial College London developing the Total Meniscus Replacement, a unique entirely anatomical replacement for the meniscus of the knee.<br /><br />We are developing the Total Meniscus Replacement the first entirely anatomical replacement for the meniscus of the knee. It is being engineered using a unique material structure which replicates the structure function relationship of the natural tissue. The innovative structure uses a novel fibre reinforced structure embedded in a proprietary polymer. The implant is currently in development at the pre&#45;clinical stage.<br /><br />Currently recruiting for permament staff but likely to have an internship opportunity during the summer term. The student would be able to help out with some mechanical testing in the lab and be exposed to other day&#45;to&#45;day activities such as dissection and refinement of surgical technique for our implant.

However still a big enough company that the projects you get to work on are interesting. Very friendly company, I was made to feel very welcome right from the off. Took 2 Cambridge students in total over summer 2018 a couple in previous years. Keen to have a link with new graduates as well as students from all other years. <br /><br />1A student feedback: <br />Very friendly office. Quite small office, I got to work on projects and enhance my skills in desigh.

	<td>RCG is an integrated market intelligence, management consulting and technical advisory firm. What makes us different is that we are focussed solely on the renewable energy sector. We support mainstream and emerging technologies and serve the organisations leading the transition to a low carbon economy.<br /><br />1A student feedback:<br />For this internship I was given a wide variety of tasks to do, which included everything from document review to Python coding for usage with wind analysis software. The setup was very self motivated and a large number of the tasks had little external input with the exception of a set of deliverables and<br />some preferences as to document structure. A large part of my time was spent on a research project, looking into floating offshore wind structures and documenting my findings. Being a consultancy there were instances of tight deadlines and working against the clock, which were challenging. The team<br />was 4 people and this was the entire office, which gave an atmosphere which I enjoyed, but is potentially not for all. The work the company do is majoritively on offshore wind projects, so is great for those interested in finding out about the industry, but the firm does not go into much technical detail on the machinery or structure of the turbines.

	<td>SCS generates advanced temperature maps, providing unprecedented data to redesign mission&#45;critical components. This will enable the design of higher efficiency engines as well as supporting the use of alternative fuels for climate preservation. Their dynamic company pioneers thermal history technology based on luminescence materials, combining this with advanced instrumentation and robotics for digitising the data. SCS is a global company working with blue chip organisations around the world in the power generation, aerospace and automotive industries.<br /><br />The company always seeks to provide outstanding engineering candidates a chance to work in a commercial environment and in a multi&#45;disciplinary and multi&#45;cultural team of highly talented young scientists and engineers educated to PhD level. SCS has successfully hosted several Cambridge engineering students over the past ten years.<br /><br />SCS issues specific projects for every intern every year. A list of projects will be issued to candidates following formal application. Tasks can vary depending on the preferences and background of the candidates. They are prepared to look into the special <br />preferences the candidate has. In general, the candidate will work under the supervision of a senior engineer or scientist and <br />will support them in their tasks. These could be:<br />&#42; Instrumentation &#45; Working with opto&#45;electronic devices e.g. ADCs, Labview, lasers, fibre optics.<br />&#42; Robotics & automation &#45; Working with electronic control units (ECUs), stepping motors, user interfaces using Labview.<br />&#42; Material science &#45; Paint production and application; Material characterisation XRD, SEM, induced phosphorescence measurements; Coating characterisation; Calibration measurement<br />&#42; Commercial support &#45; Making measurements for customers and reporting; Follow quality control processes; Patent searches; Literature reviews; Supporting social media<br /><br />Minimum time of internship: 11&#45;12 weeks during the summer.<br /><br />Should have relevant engineering or technical skills such as coding, robotics and instrumentation.<br />A good understanding of engineering processes.<br /><br />Internship is unpaid but will give contributions of up to &#163;100 per week for commuting.<br /><br />Current employees Fleur Conway (f.conway@sensorcoatings.com) and Ahmed Zaid (a.zaid@sensorcoatings.com), both ex&#45;CUED students, are happy to be contacted if you have any questions about the internship or company.<br /><br />Applications will be reviewed as they are received on a first come first served basis, there is no specific deadline.<br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: 11 weeks unpaid remote internship with regular visits to the office. Paid travel expenses. Free use of electronics lab and ordering of parts. Also got to use a liquid based Form 3D printer. &#39;Company is small, which means little perks, but I got heavily involved in meetings incl marketing, materials and robotics&#45; so you get a good understanding of how the company works and build a great team spirit (even though a lot of it was remote). Unfortunately they don&#39;t pay you, but since I was working on the final design of the product, they were willing to pay a lot for the costs associated with R&D (incl one day delivery). <br />The toughest part was getting past the hurdle of being thrown in the deep end from day one &#45; they expected a lot considering how little I knew and I was largely working on my own. But it very effective considering that I learned so much more about electronics than I ever would&#39;ve if I&#39;d just been playing on my RPi over summer. Also the satisfaction of working on a project that adds value to the company was well worth it.&#39;<br /><br />IA Student feedback: 12 weeks unpaid with a travel contribution. For accommodation just Google, try Rightmove or Student Mundial (strongly recommended, very good service, the one that helped me get an accommodation, and there is no service charge, completely free). <br />Sensor coating system is a very good small company. To be fair, I really appreciate that they offered me an internship in my first year.<br />Pros: <br />&#42; Get the chance to know everyone. One of the traditions in this company is Lunch talk in which everyone gathers together during lunchtime and talk from Brexit to the sunshine in Brighton. Sometimes, the boss will invite us to have a drink in a restaurant nearby after finishing work. <br />&#42; Flexible office time. Office hour: start working between 8:30 to 10:00am and leave office between 5 to 7pm. So you don&#39;t need to get up very early every day. Also, even if you appear in the office at 10:15, it&#39;s also OK. There is also an one hour breaktime for you to have lunch. <br />&#42; Freedom.  For the project I did, I got lots of freedom. My two tutors would only give me some proper guidance when I need it, and they respected every idea I came up no matter how naive it was. So, I can fully unleash my creativity and come up with lots of crazy ideas. If you are a person who enjoy freedom at work, this company definitely suits you.<br />Cons <br />&#42; Location.  This company is located at Dagenham, zone 5 in east London. Therefore, it is a bit hard to find a good accommodation nearby. I stayed in Stratford when I was doing the internship, but the rent was a bit expensive. <br />&#42; No salary .  It is an unpaid internship though the company provides travel expense &#45;&#45;&#45; 50 pounds per week. <br />A bit about my internship in general. I first want to talk something that I didn&#39;t realise before I start the internship. <br />&#42; Internship is like a proper job, not like the lab coursework in Cambridge. I used to think the internship would be like doing labs: you get into the office with some documents (like the lab handout showing you what to do) already sitting on your table. Then you just need to follow the steps on the documents and ask your tutor &#45; who will be next to you all the time &#45; whenever you meet some problems. Next day you get some different documents and deal with them in a similar way. And then you repeat this kind of life for three months.  However, this is not true. First, there is no documents like that &#45; you need to decide what kind of tasks you need to do today, how you are going to set up experiments and how much progress you should achieve today. Secondly, your tutors will be very busy. They will probably be able to meet you only once or twice every day because they are full&#45;time employees who have lots of work to do. This means that whenever you meet some problems, you have to try to solve it by yourself first. Even when you are struggled with something, like not being able to come up with a good mechanical design, your tutors can only provide you with some suggestions. They will not help you come up a design &#45;&#45;&#45; you need to do it by yourself. Their job is to inspire and guide you, not do the job for you. In the first few weeks of the internship, I simply cannot get used to this kind of lifestyle. I got used to the lab in Cambridge where there was always someone nearby to help you, where there was a handout that clearly outlined what you should do. But a few weeks later, I started to get used to it and enjoy it.<br />&#42; Living alone is challenging.  I lived in Stratford for three months when I was doing the internship. The biggest challenging is I have no friends around me. Literally I came to a completely new environment where I can&#39;t find any friend. Also colleagues are only colleagues, I find it is hard to have more interactions with them after work. However, I think having this kind of experience will definitely help a person grow up. <br />&#42; Time management is important.  I finished my internship very rushed. In the last week, I stayed up late every day in order to finish the project in time. It is pretty challenging to manage a project that might last for three months. <br /><br />IA Student feedback: I mainly working in the paint development sector which involved lots of hands&#45;on work in the labs. This was interesting as I learnt how to use furnace, precision cutters and many other pieces of equipment.  The company is small so I got to know everyone well.  However, it is unpaid so that is a big factor to consider, especially since interns have to stay for a minimum of 10 weeks.<br /><br />IA Student feedback: I worked at Sensor Coatings for about 9 weeks. Since it Is the only place I&#39;ve done an engineering internship, I cant give much by way of comparison, but I can give you my thoughts!  SCS is a very small company, and very young, with many of the staff just graduated or PhD students. Most people work 10&#45;6 rather than 9&#45;5, which is nice if like me you are not a morning person!  You will probably find yourself working on a wide variety of tasks. I did some lab work on sample preparation and testing, data analysis in MATLAB and excel, a bit of coding and some research. So it is an internship suited for people who like being a jack of all trades. <br /><br />IA Student feedback:  I personally really enjoyed my experience there. There was a huge amount of responsibility to take on if you were up for it and they were very genuine people to work with. Let me know what sort of stuff you&#39;d like to know.<br /><br />IA Student feedback:  SCS is a very small company. When I was there, there were only about 7 or 8 full time employees (as well as 3 interns and an apprentice) and this was actually quite useful for an internship as this meant that they immediately gave interns quite important tasks which would be used by the company.<br />Also surprisingly despite the company being quite small they are surprisingly multidisciplinary; there were 3 Cambridge interns last summer: one did a lot of mechanical work (CADinG, drilling and creating touch probes for the actual measuring machine), one did a lot of electrical work (creating an electrical box which was used to turn measurements into data) and I did a lot of software work (creating a robotic arm program to move to a more versatile measuring system) and we all felt that we learned a lot in our field of interest. Since they were a small company and did everything in house there was a wide range of things which we could do and even I did a bit of mechanical work and electrical work since I was interested in trying different disciplines.<br />Also I will note that company despite the company being quite small and new it was incredibly well organised and run. They always knew what they were doing and there were genuinely smart and friendly people working and running the company. At least for my internship I was given quite interesting tasks and they made sure that I was learning as I progressed. Parts are of course going to be a bit dry (for example for some periods I had to just watch a machine take measurements and change samples) and it did take some time for me to get into my interesting projects but at the end I felt I learned a lot and really enjoyed the internship.<br />However they dont pay well&#45; in fact I often joke with my friends that I was doing slave labour as it was only 50 pounds a week and I overall paid to do the internship (since I had to pay rent)! They were also quite far out (maybe an hour out from central london) and not in the best area (there isnt very much around and SCS is the only &#39;good&#39; company around). I lived there and although there were a few nearby nature reserves, it really isn&#39;t the most beautiful part of London.<br />So I suppose it depends on what you&#39;re interested in but I was really happy with the experience I had and really felt I developed a lot as an engineer.<br /><br />IA Student feedback::  I interned at Sensor Coating Systems last summer for 12 weeks. I spent the most of my time there working on identifying new areas of improvement for the current optical device that the company uses in their temperature measurement system. This involved developing optical simulations and experiments, 3D drawing and printing of optical mounts. It was a good experience overall and I was working quite closely with one of the company&#39;s instrumentation engineer most of the time. It&#39;s also a fairly small company, so you get to know what everyone is working on and learn stuff beyond your project. I quite like the working environment as it was quite open and not fast&#45;paced but not too laid&#45;back either. I don&#39;t recall the interview being very difficult or technical and I think it was more on trying to know which area of the project that you are interested in.

Get a feel for life as a professional digital engineer, building real&#45;world software.<br />Under the guidance of experienced developers, their interns form a team to create a commercial&#45;grade application. This might be for a client, or it might be a pro bono project or it might be addressing a need within Softwire.<br /><br />Recent examples include a skills&#45;tracker for Potential Plus UK, and a website for Pungo to monitor the mental wellbeing of elderly people.<br /><br />Their summer internships typically last 8&#45;12 weeks. A passion for coding is a bonus.<br /><br /><br /><br />IA student feedback can be found on the Industrial Placements website: https://www.placements.eng.cam.ac.uk/Search/Feedback/Feedback/softwire&#45;london&#45;ia&#45;feedback<br /><br />IA student feedback: 8 weeks remote paid internship.   I had an amazing experience! It was an internship in full stack app development. All 8 weeks were run remotely (although I went in to the office to work twice), but my trainer from the company kept in close contact, with regular meetings 2&#45;3 times a day. Social breaks via video call were planned with my trainer and the other interns in my group, allowing us to develop relationships with each other. We were thrown into the deep end a bit in the first couple weeks, but it helped us learn quickly and efficiently, and the work was on a commercial project, so it was cool to code things knowing that they would have a real impact on the client&#39;s app. There were plenty of virtual morale events after the working day, as well as organised virtual &#39;coffee meets&#39; to get to know other permanent employees in the company, which was really useful. Overall I gained a huge amount of experience and knowledge in software development as well as information about the industry from this internship.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 8 weeks paid remote internship.  During my internship I worked on a web development project for a client running a startup business (most of Softwire&#39;s intern projects are pro bono for charities or startups). I was given plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and furthermore was able to get involved with a number of the company&#39;s social/non work&#45;related activites.<br /><br />IA student feedback: https://tinyurl.com/SoftwireLon<br /><br />IB student feedback: 8 weeks paid remote internship with visits to the office. Generally great company, wish I could have done it non&#45;remotely because of all the cool stuff that usually goes on at the office :(<br /><br />IB student feedback: 8 weeks paid over &#163;450 per week plus social events,  gym membership, an additional 3.5 days of holiday to be used for company &#39;morale&#39; events, free snacks, quite flexible hours and cheap food in the canteen.  <br />Softwire was a fantastic company to work for; the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, they had a lot of fun (and free) social events, and I learnt a lot while I was there. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who thinks they might want to get into software development but does not have much experience in it.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 8 weeks paid remote internship. Overall it&#39;s well organised. The project is carefully chosen and there&#39;s some freedom. You get to talk to other full time employers as well. Downsides: it&#39;s a bit hard getting started. You&#39;re supposed to pick it up on the job but the learning curve is very steep.

Through the scheme, students will gain an understanding of the research environment and develop new skills.<br /><br />The scheme offers a selection of exciting research projects hosted by different ICR teams across their Chelsea or Sutton sites. They are to be carried out for a 6 &#45; 8 week period during the 2023 summer vacation. These will give insights into scientific research and the opportunity to work under leading UK academics and clinicians. Funds are available for up to seven undergraduate students to undertake a six to eight week research project (with a stipend of &#163;300 per week).<br /><br />Applications are encouraged from students who have not previously undertaken any form of summer placement.<br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: 6 week remote paid internship. I worked on MATLAB altering and merging image construction algorithms in an attempt to speed up the time taken to get from raw MRI imaging data to the actual image. I also worked on removing &#39;artefacts&#39; my from MRI images by combining two image construction algorithms.<br /><br />IB student feedback: I completed a bioinformatics project, searching for risk factors of different cancers using genetic data. No biology background required, as most of the project was coding. I used R and bash, both of which were new to me, and was given a couple of days to get up to scratch. The team in the lab I was in were all really happy to help, and it was a great experience.<br />	Yes	Silvia: silvia.alvarezperez@icr.ac.uk &#45; I was one of my students on a larger scheme that runs each year, SIlvia does the admin for this.

	<td>NERC recognises that there is a shortage of individuals with quantitative skills coming into environmental science. The REP scheme aims to address this shortage by offering funding to support summer placements for undergraduate students studying quantitative disciplines outside NERC remit, during which they will undertake research within the environmental sciences. These 8 week placements give a taster of what it&#39;s like to be a postgraduate researcher and encouraging undergraduates to consider a career in the environmental sciences. As such, the scheme is restrictive in terms of student eligibility and is not open to students already studying within NERC&#39;s science remit.<br /><br />Full details of the REPs projects will be available are on our website. In brief, the placement includes a salary, paid at no less than the minimum wage, and the placement will be for 8 consecutive weeks.

	<td>A provider of Artificially Intelligent wireless smart sensor systems for infrastructure monitoring and the development of Smart Cities. Their patented technology has been used in a variety of major national infrastructure projects including London&#39;s Crossrail and Thames Tideway. UtterBerry&#39;s electronics technology is also used to create Smart IoT devices. The company was founded by Heba Bevan in 2013 as a spin&#45;out from Cambridge University. The company is based in London, the Smart sensors are all manufactured within the UK and exported throughout the world.<br /><br />UtterBerry is looking for capable and motivated hardware, software, and mechanical engineers to help develop the next generation of artificially intelligent sensor systems being used to solve a broad range of challenges in the creation of smart cities.<br />UtterBerry is a spin&#45;out from Cambridge University, and the company is fast&#45;moving, young, ever&#45;changing and, of course, fun.<br /><br />Have taken students since 2018.<br /><br />2A student feedback: Nice company to work for, very keen to have interns (especially from Cambridge). Company is a bit disorganised but otherwise a pleasure to work for them.<br /><br />IA student feedback: 11, with 1 week&#39;s unpaid holiday. The internship offer was 14 weeks with up to 4 weeks unpaid holiday. Paid over &#163;450 per week. Occasional drinks events; basic free food and drinks in the office. Employees were lovely, very chilled atmosphere, frequent drinks events. Worked on a range of things. Mostly, interns&#39; work was not &#39;insulated&#39; like it can be at large companies, which was good. Unfortunately, due to company structure & withholding of information to protect IP, things sometimes appeared quite chaotic and disorganised, with projects suddenly changing and sometimes unclear goals in projects.

Interns contribute to the development of the Verdantix business through work on research projects, marketing events and sales campaigns. This ensures interns get a wide range of business experience which enhances knowlegde of the climate change sector as well as developing commercial skills. We welcome applications throughout the year for positions in our London office. Internships are typically for a period of 10 to 12 weeks. Please send a resume to: svine@verdantix.com<br /><br /><br />STUDENT FEEDBACK<br /><br />Working for Verdantix gave me a lot of responsibility from the start as they are a relatively small company. I was able to speak to CEOs and head up my own research project about the views of sustainability in large corporations, as well as exploring interesting sustainability technology on a smaller scale. I also got the chance to move to London and spend the summer outside of a quiet provincial town, which is always a plus&#45; right?<br /><br />I got the idea for the placement from the CHOICE database so I&#39;m really glad I used that.

As an intern, you will get the chance to take part in building real&#45;world solutions, learn and develop your skills and make a difference in a fast&#45;growing startup and a super friendly environment. <br /><br />Get in touch if you are looking for at least 10 weeks internship.<br /><br />We are open to students from all years but (on the evidence of past years) first&#45;years would have to be able to demonstrate skills and experiences already gained. <br /><br />Main Location is London but Cambridge possible as well.<br /><br />IB STUDENT FEEDBACK: Undertaking an internship at Vivacity Labs has enabled me to discover the application of machine learning in the context of transport (e.g. vehicles on roads). Having worked on the integration of a machine learning framework into an automatic number plate recognition system to facilitate the determination of traffic journey time was a unique experience that allowed me to gain valuable programming skills. With the support of the entire team, I was able to become familiar with the process of developing code, getting it reviewed, adjusting it and integrating it into the original program. Working in this company allowed me to develop my skills in C++ and apply the knowledge acquired along the Engineering course. Working with the team at Vivacity labs was a wonderful experience as I felt fully integrated within the team and enjoyed attending social events with the rest of the company. This internship has enabled me to become more confident in C++ programming as those who I worked with were always willing to help and guided me through my project in a way that allowed me to be independent while having the opportunity to ask for help whenever it was needed.

	<td>Walsh is a top UK structural and civil engineering consultancy who specialise in urban regeneration projects. They have a strong commitment to sustainable design and its inclusion in their projects. Sustainability and renewable energy are very important parameters in the development and specification of the structural form. <br /><br />Structural Engineering remains at their core but they have extensive expertise in civil engineering enabling them to provide a comprehensive engineering service complete with multi&#45;disciplinary consultants.<br /><br />A passion for engineering and design often starts early, so Walsh are proud to offer work experience opportunities to A level students as well as undergraduates. If you&#39;re interested, please submit your CV and covering letter to careers@walsh.co.uk<br /><br />Student feedback: The internship consisted of 6 weeks of working in a London office, close to Tower Bridge, within a team of 6 engineers. Throughout the internship I was required to do some design calculations for buildings currently under construction, as well as some quantity analysis of existing buildings and some fee proposal calculations for new jobs. I also got the opportunity to do some more hands on activities&#45; with a couple of visits to site and lots of chances to produce construction drawings and mark&#45;ups. <br />The good bits: I was given a lot of responsibility and also learned a lot that I would not have known from the structures teaching in department. I also was able to live at home and commute into London which made the financial gain significant. I never got bored.<br />The bad bits: It was quite tiring working 9&#45;5:30 every day, and the work is almost all sat at a desk.
