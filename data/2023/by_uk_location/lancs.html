Although it was remote &#45; BAE had social reps and they organised 2 in person socials where I was able to meet more interns and grads. I was hired as an aerospace engineer but due to the huge volume of interns &#45; I had a more info/ Data Science role. <br /><br />At first, I was very apprehensive, however by the end I loved it and gained more of a passion for Info Engineering. My line manager was very supportive and helpful and everyone was so keen and willing to share information.<br /><br />Amazing experience and would definitely recommend.<br /><br />IA student feedback: Coding new tasks for the software radio products that BAE AI develop.

I had to opportunity to improve my 3D modelling and drawing skills using Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD and Vault. I learnt the basics of isolator and down flow booth operation and considerations during design, as well as an introduction to stainless steel fabrication and the challenges of manufacturing complex equipment. Working with clients, from kick off meetings to Factory Acceptance Tests, was a great way for me to learn more about the design process and industry standards. My design work wasn&#39;t only for current projects, but also longer term Howorth goals, namely designing concepts for a mezzanine and office extension to make the best use of space. Towards the end of my placement, I enjoyed doing project work, looking at how documentation could be used to improve the design process. Specifically, I created the basis of a project tracker using Excel, that included an action tracker, writing detailed mechanical design checklists, peer reviews and meeting agendas for different stages of the design process. <br />Overall, my time at Howorth certainly gave me experience and knowledge that is missing from an academic university course. I couldn&#39;t have asked for a warmer welcome to the company.

It includes being paired up with a buddy from our Women in Engineering Network and Allies group . Plus, they&#39;ll give you a bursary on the understanding that you return to JLR for repeat placements or are offered a place to join their graduate scheme when you&#39;ve completed your studies.<br /><br />2A Student feedback: JLR internships are hit and miss, key part is filling in the preference form after your offer letter. Be as specific as possible with what you want to do otherwise the allocation process is almost entirely random and individual managers have no control over this, their senior manager allocates them interns so they might not even be aware they have an intern until your first day at the office.<br />Good bits: technical placement on FE analysis of different crash load cases for safety development of a component; full training provided on industry standard software; real responsibility on live projects. <br />Bad bits: not everyone is lucky with their placements, many are stuck with doing &#39;theoretical studies&#39;; work can be repetitive; everyone starts at 7.30am even though it is technically flexi time; living in Coventry

The experience gained in AMP3 led KMI Water to consolidate the current delivery team by integrating support services group Mouchel Parkman into the KMI Plus joint venture to provide additional focus, resources and efficiencies which would bring even more benefits to United Utilities throughout the AX4 framework period.

MBDA are reasonably well organised and so you have work to do the majority of the time. Since the Bolton site is a factory you get to spend a lot of the time hands on with state of the art equipment.<br />In terms of the application, the assessment day involves a presentation, a group task and formal interview. It is a fairly relaxed situation. There is opportunity to be invited back for either a second placement or a graduate role.

As Mutech is a small company (12 members in our team), you will gain a broad view of the business from top to bottom.<br /><br />Students should have an interest in electronic design.<br /><br />Feedback from student: Fast&#45;paced with lots of independent work, quite a small company and they only have one intern each year.<br /><br />IB student feedback: 7 weeks paid over &#163;300 per week plus social events and there was a company day trip for all employees.<br />I found Mutech a great company to work for, they were very understanding about travel arrangements if you are coming in from a distance. They gave me some interesting projects and I felt I definitely learnt a lot from my internship with them.

Its products are used on regional jets, business jets and commercial aircraft with more than 100 seats for medium &#45; and long&#45;range travel.<br /><br />Past internships have been to assist on various projects in materials (metallurgy or carbon fibre composites) or stress analysis (structures, loads, etc.), or design (geometry, digital mock&#45;up, 3D printing), or projects (planning, schedule preparation, etc.).<br /><br />The minimum internship duration for non&#45;UK residents is 6 months.<br /><br />Student feedback: Safran Nacelles is a very friendly company that has many interns over the summers. They seem to know how to make it a valuable experience for the interns.  I worked on a VBA project in the repairs team in Burnley, therefor I really enhanced by programming skills over the summer. I also learnt about more details Nacelles thrust reverse design and damage assessment methods.  My tutor was very helpful and enthusiastic. The only negative was Burnley s a town, because as there is nothing to do in the evenings, but there are various national parks nearby for weekend cycling trips, and also some larger cities are around.
