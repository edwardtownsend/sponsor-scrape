	<td>They have over twenty five years experience in metal fabrications and a growing and extensive client base. Consequently they supply products to a wide range of services and industries alike.<br /><br />Their services include all aspects of the manufacturing process. From an initial idea or specification they work with you to take it through to completion and delivery. Furthermore, this service applies whether this is a one off bracket or a large batch multi&#45;part production run.<br />Due to their manufacturing methods there are no real limits to what they can produce. The company continually strives to achieve the most competitive manufacturing method and cost effective outcome.<br /><br />IA Student feedback: 1 week unpaid. It was a small company that was owned by a larger company and that resulted in a lot of back and forth and uncertainty about what was available and what needed to be done.

	<td>Align is a joint venture of three international and privately&#45;owned infrastructure companies; Bouygues Travaux Publics, a subsidiary of Bouygues Construction, Sir Robert McAlpine, and VolkerFitzpatrick, a subsidiary of VolkerWessels. Our combined experience, both in the UK and worldwide, in delivering high&#45;profile infrastructure projects safely, on time and on budget, has long established our reputation.<br /><br />HS2 C1 PACKAGE<br />In July 2017 the Align joint venture was awarded the C1 package of the UK High Speed 2 line (HS2). C1 consists of 21.6km of high speed rail infrastructure <br />in a rural environment. This will include a 3.37km viaduct, 16.04km twin&#45;bored tunnel and five vent shafts handling both intervention <br />and tunnel ventilation facilities.<br /><br />All three companies are agile businesses that have developed into world&#45;class contractors, due to our individual commitment to outstanding innovation and engineering. This is supported by a common focus on building relationships of trust with our clients and other key stakeholders including their employees, the supply chain and local communities in which we operate.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: 		The company was very friendly and I had a great mentor who put a lot of time and effort into  teaching me.  It is a huge project which is very exciting and I had a great balance between being in the office and getting to go on site.  It is in Rickmansworth and therefore if you do not have a car can be time consuming to get to (they have a shuttle bus to and from the station).

	<td>AND Technology Research is a purpose&#45;led technology and product development consultancy. They have been turning pioneering ideas into reality since 1980. During those 40 years, they&#39;ve delivered on everything from the first&#45;ever SMS text message to life&#45;saving equipment for firefighters.<br /><br />They mainly focus on projects within the following markets:<br />&#149;	Internet of Things<br />&#149;	Embedded devices<br />&#149;	AI & data Analytics<br />&#149;	Medical Devices<br />&#149;	Energy Management<br /><br />They have a track record of delivering excellence in everything they do. With a proven approach to successful product development, they&#39;re proud to say that they can bring a product to market from any development stage.<br /><br />The company has great flexibility in terms of projects for a student, and they try to work with their interns to provide an internship that will benefit the company, provide a learning experience for the student, and be an all&#45;round beneficial and enjoyable experience for all involved.<br /><br />They structure their internships around a project that meets a real world need for the company &#45; in the past this has included creating a replacement doorbell/door lock system with their IoT platform, MATLAB applications for a mechanical analysis company, or Full stack development of a timesheet management system. They&#39;re keen to work with any applicants to provide something meaningful to them as well, that will provide value to all involved. As such they only ask that applicants are:<br />&#45; Able to work in a team and independently.<br />&#45; Confident at communicating their ideas both verbally and written, and willing to listen when others do the same.<br />&#45; Curious about how systems work and how to improve them.<br />&#45; Focused on bringing a project through to completion.<br />&#45; Interested in learning more about the Product development lifecycle.<br /><br />Real world project experience is a plus, even if it&#39;s just tinkering with an Arduino, as long as applicants are able to discuss why they did something, and what they learnt.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: Exposure to plethora of software and hardware engineering tasks.<br /><br />	AND Technology Research is a small technological consultancy firm (~10 employees in total) who specialise in projects surrounding embedded devices although they are beginning to branch off into medical compliance regulatory work. Most of my internship was focused around developing their internal software through mini projects on various MCU boards which gave me a practical understanding of how embedded devices are taken from a whiteboard concept to market. This role is best suited for engineers with an interest in software, informational and hardware engineering.

Bedford is quite a boring city, there isn&#39;t much to do, but it&#39;s quite cheap and easy to get to Cambridge on the X5 bus so I&#39;d usually spend my weekends there with other friends who had internships. In terms of getting to work, I mostly cycled to work which is about 20 mins from surrounding residential areas, but also took the bus some days. Since the internship was mainly hardware focused, I found that the work I was doing was sometimes made limited by the delivery time of parts and materials.

Each of these locations does different things which I was unaware of! The location closer to my home focused on helicopters and I thought all locations did, as it was called &#39;Leonardo Helicopters&#39;, however the Luton branch focused on electronics and avionics. This was fine for me as I applied for software anyway, but several interns were confused at what the site actually focused on when we arrived. Also worth noting that with all British aerospace companies, it is difficult to get an internship without British citizenship. A good part of the internship was an intern group project running for 6 weeks of the placement. each team chooses project brief and then works through a project lifecycle to design and finally prototype a solution to the brief. This was very beneficial to me in terms of business experience in the engineering.<br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: My placement with Leonardo was at their Luton site, and I was placed on the Academic Work Stream(AWS). We had 11 intern students in one team, all assigned different roles, such as Systems Engineer, Antenna Engineer, Software, Firmware, etc. We were given a project to run for the duration of the placement, starting with a customer statement, and were given the freedom to develop the project as we saw appropriate. I found the placement very interesting, as it gave a hands&#45;on approach to learning more about RF electronics and Leonardo&#39;s role in Electronic Warfare for the aerospace defence industry. I am not sure if this is the way it is run in other locations of the company, since AWS is a scheme that Leonardo, Luton have run only since 2021 &#45; before that, students were placed into different project teams across the company. Overall, I had a brilliant experience on this placement and other interns in my team also felt the same way. Leonardo&#39;s placements are focused on electronics, since they are an aerospace electronics company.

	<td>LEX Diagnostics is developing a low&#45;cost, hand&#45;held, medical diagnostics system to provide test for common viral infections in as little as 5 minutes. This is enabled bytechnology developed in recent years at our parent company, TTP. Our system will bring tests for flu and COVID&#45;19 to the frontline of healthcare and beyond to radically change how such infections are tracked and diagnosed.<br /><br />IB student feedback:  LEX Diagnostics is a spin&#45;out from TTP, and is developing a point of care molecular diagnostic device for respiratory viruses, so their work involves mechanical engineering, electronics and software, and biology. <br />I always had something to do, it seemed like they were happy to have me there, and the people I was doing work for always responded quickly and were really helpful when I had questions.  I spent most of the time carrying out verification tests, created some Python scripts to help analyse data, learned about how to best represent data in an informative way, learned about PCB design using Altium, and went to and contributed to an FMEA meeting which is something that isn&#39;t taught in tripos but can be really useful.  I also got to observe during meetings with prospective clients and manufacturers, and even got to do some biology. <br />The placement was a little disorganised &#45; LEX is still quite a new company and I was the first intern they had.  I didn&#39;t have one project to work on the whole time but rather was given many smaller pieces of work by various people from across the business, which meant that I didn&#39;t always know what I would be doing from one week to the next.&#39;

The Company offers mission planning systems, command and control products, synthetic environments, aerodynamics, propulsion technology, lethality and warheads, sensors, missile dynamics, and image processing algorithms. MBDA serves army, navy, and air forces in the United Kingdom.<br /><br />This is a fantastic opportunity to experience real&#45;life work and discover the path you might want to take on your future career. It&#39;s all hands&#45;on work and you&#39;ll gain exposure to real projects, where you can contribute as a valued team member. <br /><br />They offer summer placements in business, engineering, software and manufacturing for university students who are anywhere from their first to final year of study. These run for 10 &#45; 12 weeks, starting in June.<br /><br />IB student feedback: Initially, I was given a placement in an area I was not interested in (hardware). After a few weeks, I asked if it was possible to change and I was able to do this with no problem (systems). However, the second area I was in was not prepared for me so it took a while to get organised. It was largely online, which meant I found it difficult to ask for help, and although I could work in person there were very few others on site so it was quite isolating. The work, however, was interesting and challenging, and felt as if I was actually contributing something useful to the company. I was offered another internship for next summer as well, and they often offer people going into their final year a place on their graduate scheme.

	<td>Pinnacle is a leading provider of construction consulting services with a comprehensive background in Structural and Civil Engineering.<br /><br />Their new office space in Welwyn Garden City provides opportunities for some much&#45;needed downtime after working to client deadlines by providing recreational spaces with a Pool table and Table Football.<br /><br />They recognise that &#39;trying out&#39; companies is a great way to gain an initial introduction to their business, projects, and culture, and so they encourage placements, both during summer holidays (usually around 8&#45;weeks), and as Professional Training Years (12&#45;15 months) sandwiched during academic study.<br /><br />If students are looking for paid internships, you&#39;d need to be with them for more than 8 weeks.  For less than 8 weeks, they can provide free work experience; this is normally limited to 1 to 2 weeks and typically takes place during the Christmas or Easter breaks.<br /><br /><br />They are looking for self&#45;starters who are committed to sustainable development, lifelong learning, and making a difference.  No previous experience is necessary, although candidates should be able to evidence problem&#45;solving skills, team&#45;working skills, and a strong commitment to their own learning and development. They want to know what you bring as an individual, so sharing your hobbies and interests is great, to help them understand what makes you tick.<br /><br />Salary is dependent on experience: 1/2/3 years study.<br /><br />Start dates can be flexible, but usually summer placements start in June/July, and year placements can start anytime between June and November.<br /><br />The Welwyn Garden City office is approximately a 10&#45;15&#45;minute walk from Welwyn Garden City train and bus stations where you can catch train links to/from London Kings Cross, Moorgate, and Cambridge. Bus links are available to/from Stevenage, Luton, St Albans, and Heathrow.

In 1992 the company expanded to incorporate an EMC test facility, to ensure that in house designs met type approval and EMC requirements. When the European directive on EMC became mandatory, the service was made available to meet the increasing demand for EMC testing. <br /><br />In July 2002 we incorporated the Cambridge based test house of CTMS into our facility at Brentwood, Essex, as part of our focus on expanding our test services. We aim to offer all the services provided through CTMS directly or through our strategic partnership.   <br /><br />We also offer a complete range of other services based on our RF design expertise. This extends to project management and includes many electronics disciplines. Our EMC experience enables us to ensure that our designs are tailored to meeting any regulatory requirements.

	<td>TTP is an independent technology and product development company. They work in partnership with their clients to bring new products to market, creating new business from advances in technology, and making an impact on the world and people&#39;s lives. They are based in Melbourn, just outside Cambridge.<br /><br />The length of this internship can be flexible according to individual circumstances, but they do ask for a commitment of a minimum of nine weeks.<br />They encourage you to apply as early as possible as they review applications on a rolling basis.<br />Experience of prior internships or extracurriculars applying your degree are desirable but not essential.<br /><br />IB student feedback can be found on the Industrial Placements website: https://www.placements.eng.cam.ac.uk/Search/Feedback/Feedback/awerian&#45;part&#45;ttp&#45;technology&#45;partnership&#45;cambridge&#45;ib&#45;feedback<br /><br />IB student feedback. Worked for Awerian, a TTP spin out.		Great experience of taking a project from start to finish &#45; from the design stage all the way to testing a final circuit. Great company with welcoming and helpful people. Highly recommend. Learnt a lot of technical skills as well had a chance to develop presentation and time management skills.<br /><br />IA student feedback: Internship was good, very interesting work, learnt a lot (both technical information and business knowledge)<br /><br />IB student feedback: 8 weeks paid. 	Worked on different phases of product development as a technical consultant, including competitor research, supplier comparison, CAD design, and experimental testing. Great support received from coworkers, relaxed environment and flexible hours.<br /><br />2A student feedback: Fantastic social and sports:<br />	Free swimming pool at the local leisure centre (5 mins walk away) which we could use during the hour lunch break or any other time after work.<br />Free use of the squash courts over lunch at the local leisure centre and an established squash club within work so its easy to find people to play against no matter what level you are (I was only just beginning and it was really good fun)<br />	Badminton at lunch at another leisure centre once a week (extends your lunch break by about an hour though).<br />	Basically lots of sports you can get involved in over the hour lunch break. People play football, go for runs, do circuits workouts etc.<br />	Lots of socials in my group (medical devices) &#45;> weekly pub trips after work or during lunch when someone is leaving. Almost always free cake/sweets that someone has brought in. Quite a few international people in the medical devices group, and quite a lot of young interns and year in industry students (about 3 interns and 3 year in industry students in my group of about 30 people, and about 15 summer interns across the company).<br />Really friendly atmosphere. Everyone is incredibly helpful and insanely intelligent. They are a group of highly driven individuals so often work overtime so that can seem a bit daunting if you want to leave on time, but there is no pressure to do overtime in theory. Overtime is unpaid, but lots of people find themselves with deadlines for clients that they want to finish because they are genuinely passionate about their work so they often stay later, sometimes even until 8pm (only about once a month though). I was surprised this actually happened to me during my placement at the end too.<br />Flat company structure so the idea is you can get involved with any project at any level. If you find a project you are interested in, get to know the people over lunch and ask to get involved. They are all happy to try and get you to learn the most possible during the placement. You need to be quite driven as the work won&#39;t necessarily come to you, but you have to direct yourself and find it by talking to people and showing your interest in it. There&#39;s opportunities to really take ownership of projects and even do your own research thing if you have an idea and think it has a business case for the company.<br />Normal working hours are 9 to 5.30 with an hour lunch break and there isn&#39;t any flexi&#45;time at the moment but I think lots of people in the company are unhappy with this and they are trying to get it changed. The people are awesome, the work and projects are interesting, and I had a great placement. You will mostly only get to work on projects within your group so if you can, show during your interview or on your application which group you are most interested in (medical devices, clinical systems, life sciences, industrial, applied technologies, sensors and devices etc.). A lot of the work is just testing as you need to make design changes then see if the performance is improved etc, but if you push for it you can try to get more control over the design of the tests, and even the most senior people spend a fair amount of time in the labs doing the &#39;boring&#39; testing. They will also happily take any insight you can give and let you help with analysis of the results after testing.<br />The site is fairly far south from Cambridge (about an hours cycle from where I was staying in North cam, but there is a train or you can share lifts with other people coming from Cambridge like I did).<br />They put on a talk every Friday with people from other parts of the company to give talks about what they have done at ttp so we could get a feel for the other projects and groups that we were not a part of. At the end of the placement we all gave a presentation about what we had done.<br />You get a mentor who helps make sure you&#39;re settling in ok, and tries to get you involved in the work you most want to do. Mine helped me get involved with a human factors study in London which was really interesting.

It was founded  to carry out fundamental scientific research into natural rubber, to establish its structure and explain its elastic behaviour. <br /><br /><br />Student feedback: Projects covered electronics, software and materials and testing . Very practical and hands on and a very supportive work environment.  It is a beautiful site in rural Hertfordshire and we were advised of accommodation nearby.<br /><br />IB student feedback: The hardest part of the internship that I found was finding accommodation. This was mainly because the internship was organised last minute. The location of the internship is amazing, in a pretty town a short hop away from London. I also really enjoyed the work and the atmosphere.
