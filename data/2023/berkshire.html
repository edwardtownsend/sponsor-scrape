Their team does include several Cambridge Alumni including those who joined them as interns.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: 		My internship was with the consultancy team at automation consultants. I spent about two weeks training to get used to using and configuring Atlassian software (mainly Jira, some confluence and a little bit with bitbucket and bamboo). I then moved on to helping different members of their team with client work. Most of my tasks involved either research or providing proof of concepts. The research was mostly interesting, the proof of concepts where were the most interesting though. The proof of concepts involved a fair bit of coding, I wrote Python scripts to facilitate migrations between different versions of Jira or from different applications for Jira, I also programmed using Groovy (Java based) to configure automations within Jira.<br />https://tinyurl.com/ACReading

	<td>	D2H is a young and ambitious engineering group, based in Buckingham and Indianapolis, USA, working in motorsport and other sporting and commercial sectors. D2H group services include aerodynamics, design, FEA and mathematical modelling, as well as overall project management, and it provides these services to multinational corporations in the UK, Europe, USA and Australia. D2H Aero is the aerodynamic solutions provider, and is responsible for defining, managing and analysing all aerodynamic programs inside the D2H group, utilising wind tunnels, CFD and trackside testing. <br /><br />	D2H already works closely with Cambridge University on the Great Britain Track Cycling Olympic programme.<br /><br />D2H can support the successful candidate to locate local accommodation for the duration of the internship.<br /><br />2A student feedback 2018: Stayed in some of the University of Buckingham accommodation, Chris at D2H helped organise this. Emailed the accommodation office there. Cost was around 850 pounds for 8 weeks.  Possibly because it is still quite a small company, there wasn&#39;t really a formal induction or anything so I had to find out admin information myself &#45; when we get paid, hours of work, when&#39;s lunch etc.&#45; so it took a while to get settled.  I worked on automating the CFD process at D2H using Python. I didn&#39;t know much about CFD beforehand but they knew this and were very happy to introduce me to it. The management style was quite relaxed and I felt quite independent in my work, which I liked and it helped me feel part of the company, but people were very happy to help if needed. The managers were happy for me to get involved in other activities as well, so I managed to go to some wind tunnel testing sessions. The internship was really good experience and D2H work on some very interesting projects.

	<td>Hire purchase used car finance experts here to help you find the right hp package for you, we can also find the perfect car too!<br /><br /><br />IA student feedback: &#39;My placement was in the Analytics department, which involved using various software tools to look at data obtained by the company. Among the software used: Excel (including VBA, pivot tables), SQL, Looker, Python (mostly simple scripting, but also some more advanced data visualisation) and Confluence. Many of these are widely used across many industries so this was very useful in learning some new skills.<br /><br />The good: great company culture, very relaxed atmosphere, even the CEO is chill, flexible working hours, nice management (certainly in my case anyway) <br /><br />The bad: I had a lot of IT issues during the onboarding process, if you&#39;re working remotely and live in the North it&#39;s impossible to get to the main Oxford office for a visit by 9am (surprisingly no trains in my case!)

They believe in supporting their future talent and their placements will help you with your future career pathway, develop your technical knowledge and enhance your personal skills.<br /><br /><br />IB student feedback can be found on the Industrial Placements website: https://www.placements.eng.cam.ac.uk/Search/Feedback/Feedback/reaction&#45;engines&#45;abingdon&#45;ib&#45;feedback<br /><br />IB student feedback: 		I did a 10 week internship working in the Applied Technologies department. Overall, it was incredibly valuable and a great experience and I can&#39;t recommend it enough to anyone who wants to work in Space, aerospace or motorsport. From the start I was treated as another engineer in the modelling team and was brought onto real client projects. They are very open to the work you do, I was more interested and skilled in scientific programming and machine learning, so I was able to work on things related to that, but if you enjoyed writing GUIs or doing CFD, then they would happily find you things to do on that. The work is also very innovative in that they employ interns to scope ideas that the company doesn&#39;t have the time resources for, so I always felt like I was working on projects with real value and using modern technology. The flip side of this is that it can be quite daunting at the start, as there is no &#39;easy&#39; work to do and it does require doing research and being confident in getting help. However, once you realise how chilled and helpful everyone is, it becomes a good thing. The one bad thing is that Oxford is expensive to live in and also expensive to take the train to. I was able to drive in from London (50 min drive) a couple times a week which was not too bad.

Regardless of your specialty across STEM areas, you will be directly involved in the performance of the current race car. This could include aerodynamic development; aero systems / software engineering; mechanical and model design; aerodynamic surfacing; CFD methodology.<br /><br /><br />IIA student:  Intermitted from the course. Paid over &#163;400 per week. It is a very good place to find out about the automotive industry /F1. All the people are very friendly and always willing to answer questions and assist you. In my team, I was asked which projects I would like to work on after given options which I think is really important. Salary is better than similar F1 roles. The location is not ideal but because all interns live close together and you get in contact with them in advance it is easy to meet and hang out with them.  Very good experience overall.

	<td>Siemens Healthineers is an international organisation that works for people to live longer, more fulfilled and happier lives. Siemens Magnet Technology is the world leading designer and manufacturer of superconducting magnetic resonance imaging magnets for medical applications. <br /><br /><br />IB student feedback: 8 wek paid over &#163;400 per week. 		Great company to work at. Good location just outside Oxford (requires private accommodation though). Very reasonable working hours and friendly people at the company. I wanted to do software but the company is not great for that, all parts of engineering are used &#45; this may be a good or a bad thing! Part of Siemens (very large company), so quite a lot of admin to get started. I got the internship through a scholarship scheme, but you can apply normally.<br /><br />IB student feedback: Overall my eight weeks was very enjoyable. The site is large, but the R&D department I was a part of was small (c.50 people) in comparison &#45; so it didn&#39;t particularly feel like a large company environment. <br />I was given a major project which was a little slow to get started and had to push to get some additional work in the meantime. I ended up working on two projects, one on my own and the other as part of a small group. <br />The access to technology and equipment is fantastic and I never felt limited in this sense; I could test and experiment with whatever I wanted. The work was very hands off, and so would suit someone who is self motivated and independent. In all, I got a lot out of the work that I did and it felt very appreciated by the department.

	<td>POSITION FILLED FOR SUMMER 2023<br /><br />The Steel Construction Institute is the leading, independent provider of technical expertise and disseminator of best practice to the steel construction sector. They work in partnership with clients, members and industry to help build businesses and provide competitive advantage through the commercial application of their knowledge. Much of their work is at the leading edge of technical development and they are recognised as a centre of excellence within the industry.  They currently employ 26 people, of which 3 are Cambridge graduates.<br /><br />Students should have structural engineering knowledge. Interest in the use of steel in construction would benefit both the student and SCI.<br /><br />IA feedback: The work experience was 6 weeks (although they were happy to take me for the entire summer � I<br />wanted to go travelling) split working in an office (3 days a week) and working at home. I was primarily working on Tedds, which is a user interface designer used to run calculations and produce high&#45;quality reports with the user only needing to input measurements/information required. It was primarily based in word, as an extension, where the code would be written before being stored in a library of files within the Tedds software, so it could be safely moved around. I worked on the end of<br />project work, organising the files and formatting the user interfaces so that they were easy to read and fill out. The work was good, but was a lot of working independently, so is more suited to someone who doesn�t want to work with a team.

	<td>The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) is the UK&#39;s national research organisation leading the development and commercialisation of nuclear fusion power .<br /><br />UKAEA hosts two experimental fusion devices: JET (which holds the record for fusion power!) and MAST Upgrade . Our engineers and scientists work on the operation and maintenance of these reactors as well as the planning and design of future devices (such as ITER, DEMO, and STEP ), with partners around the globe.<br /><br />UKAEA encompasses several facilities, including Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE), Hydrogen&#45;3 Advanced Technology (H3AT), Materials Research Facility (MRF), and Remote Applications in Challenging Environments (RACE). CCFE is one of the world&#39;s leading fusion research laboratories and operates the Joint European Torus (JET) on behalf of the EUROfusion research consortium, and MAST Upgrade, the UK&#39;s national fusion experiment .<br /><br />The H3AT facility provides handling and storage facilities for tritium, a key fuel for fusion reactors. At MRF we perform research and development of materials required to withstand some of the most extreme conditions on the planet. UKAEA also has a strong presence in the field of robotics through RACE, a facility focused on remote handling techniques for a wide variety of applications, both within fusion and outside of it.<br /><br />Working together, these facilities make UKAEA a key part of the global effort to realise fusion energy and provide widespread clean energy. With two sites across the UK, one based at the Culham Science Centre in Oxfordshire, and another at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Yorkshire , UKAEA is embedded in areas of scientific and technological innovation. Working at UKAEA allows one to take on a unique set of challenges while working towards a better future.<br /><br />UKAEA is launching a new undergraduate paid summer placement scheme as part of the Fusion Industry Programme (FIP). These placements will be hosted by various companies within the fusion industry for a duration of 8 weeks. The scheme is open to students of any discipline, provided they have an interest in working in the fusion industry. UKAEA shall assist with connecting students to hosts offering a placement that fits their skills and career goals. Students will undertake a project during their placement which is devised by the host organisation and then showcase their work at a presentation event held at UKAEA when the placement is completed.
