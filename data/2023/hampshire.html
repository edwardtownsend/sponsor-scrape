I was helping with site layouts, marketing, technical due diligence reports, financial models, and proposals for the company to get work. It wasn&#39;t particularly related to the engineering degree, but it was very interesting. I learned a lot about working in a consultancy. One slight downer was the fact that there wasn&#39;t much work to do, but I learned that the last intern had come at a really busy period, so it is not always quiet for the company.

I had to get used to working 9&#45;5 because it is not fun and I live about 2hrs away so I have to wake up really early to get to work on time. <br /><br />IA student feedback 2018: I really enjoyed working at Amey as the team was really nice and supportive and would help if I was unsure about something. I would definitely recommend a similar position to anyone even remotely interested in structural engineering, as it has been great to learn how it applies to railway bridges.<br /><br />IA student feedback 2019: 7 weeks. Paid over &#163;300 per week. <br />I really enjoyed my internship. There was plenty of work for me to do and I felt like I was contributing to the company. I was completing the same tasks as a graduate student so it took a while for me to understand how to do some things, but it was satisfying to work things out by myself and I was producing important work.

Was reduced to a 2 week unpaid virtual &#39;placement experience&#39; thing. Meant that unlike last summer, where I was doing actual work, it was insted more of a workshop thing where we had a task given to us in teams. Kind of the best they could do in the situation. Their office in Epsom was closed to most employees I think and so they couldnt really offer me one in person anymore.

Working in a company is very different from academic work, and made me much more responsible and adaptive to unexpected challenges. The field I worked in (Deep Learning) also complemented the Engineering course very well, and helped me gain skills I couldn&#39;t have learned otherwise (such as implementing a full programming project in an organized setting), so I am very grateful to all the people in the company who gave me the chance to take part in this internship.

The scope of work the interns will undertake is subject to confirmation however they may be asked to assist a range of departments, subject to needs of the business.<br /><br />In order to manage the expectations of any interested students, I would like to confirm interns will be paid the National Minimum Wage during their time with us. Students will also accrue a period of annual leave.<br /><br />IIA student feedback can be found on the Industrial Placements website: <br />https://www.placements.eng.cam.ac.uk/Search/Feedback/Feedback/FlightDataServices1<br /><br />IB student feedback: Machine learning and coding in python. It&#39;s really useful as I was exposed to more &#39;professional&#39; coding, i.e. cleaner and more efficient coding techniques, friendly staff and not so strict on attire.<br />Whiteley is pretty much a business area and has very little stuff to do during free time. It would be ideal to find a place in Southampton or Portsmouth to stay and travel by train every day. The company was kind enough to suggest some links for accommodation and those were really helpful.<br />Lunch choices are quite scarce. There are only a Subway, a Domino and another sandwich shop nearby. There is a shopping mall located about 10 minutes walk away but the one&#45;hour lunch break simply doesn&#39;t allow much time for us to walk there and back. Fortunately, there is also a sandwich lady who comes in every day at around 10 am and sells sandwiches, baguettes and some hot food. Most people in the office just get those as they are pretty cheap and nice.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: https://tinyurl.com/FDSWhiteley

They have extensive experience in the aerospace and defence sectors and maintains strong links with UK universities, UK, US, and European Government research agencies. FGE provides scientific and engineering R&D, software engineering and technical consultancy services.<br /><br />They are a computational physics company so you will have an interest in this field and an aspiration to learn in areas such as: numerical methods for partial differential equations, the core sciences, high performance computing, software development, machine learning and design optimisation. They commonly use Python, C++ and Fortran so experience in these programming languages may be useful though not required. You will work alongside a permanent member of staff on a real and ongoing project, and be required to meet deadlines, author reports, and describe and discuss your results.<br /><br />Must be a UK national to clear the security requirements.<br />IA student feedback 2018: I found the work challenging but I really enjoyed working in a small company, as I was given my own unique solo project to work on and it felt like I was useful. However, it was a dull office in terms of social interaction.

Our customers &#39;fly&#39; our hovercraft in all 5 continents and we support over 200 GHL craft in over 40 countries.<br /><br />Owned and supported by the Bland Group, the company has achieved strong growth.  We relocated our main manufacturing facility from Hythe to Merlin Quay, Southampton UK at the beginning of 2011, in order to increase our manufacturing capacity.  We now use lean techniques to design and manufacture high quality hovercraft for practical applications.<br /><br />STUDENT FEEDBACK 2013:  The company would be a very good placement for anyone looking to be involved in project management, small scale aero, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing or engineering design. It&#39;s a very rapidly growing company which means it&#39;s hectic enough that whilst everyone is very helpful when asked, you do need to be fairly independent, no one has much time to one&#45;on&#45;one tutor you, so it would be a better second than first year placement.

We help our customers solve their problems and implement technical and operational solutions that will improve corporate performance.<br /><br />Over the last 10 years Helios has welcomed interns to join us during the summer months. Almost half of them have accepted permanent positions with us. We have found that interns benefit from the experience and exposure to a vibrant consulting business, whilst Helios gets the chance to test&#45;drive potential employees over the period of a few months. <br /><br />Feedback <br />Wonderful boutique who do some really interesting and meaningful work charting Europe/UKs course mainly in aviation navigation. They also do work in the rail, telecommunications and safety.  Great place to take on a huge amount of project responsibility and hence learn, despite there not being a structured program in place. Amazing views of private jets in Farnborough airport from the office too.

	<td>At IBM, work is more than a job &#45; it&#39;s a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you&#39;ve never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world&#39;s most challenging problems? If so, let&#39;s talk.<br /><br />The Extreme Blue Programme is IBM&#39;s World Wide Premier Summer internship for talent and technology, design and business innovation, and is a way to discover new creative solutions to technical challenges. The internship runs for 12 weeks in the Summer.

INSDO is a relatively small company which allows you to get to know everyone in the company well from the MD to the production operatives. The staff are incredibly friendly and are genuinely interested in making your placement worthwhile to yourself and the company.  The projects I was involved in will be very different to those that a new intern may be involved in due to the changing needs of the company.

	<td>Moog design, manufacture and install optical fibre&#45;based sensing systems for the wind industry. Our work includes optical, electronic and mechanical engineering and manufacturing of the &#39;interrogator&#39; hardware, as well as composite materials in the design and manufacture our sensors.<br /><br />We can offer the chance to join a small but highly specialised engineering team who design, manufacture and operate cutting edge sensing equipment in house. There is therefore the opportunity to experience multiple aspects of work in this environment and make an appreciable contribution to the introduction of our new interrogator hardware to the market.<br /><br />As a small engineering site our staff are often involved in multiple areas of our business so the student should have an enquiring mind, wide&#45;ranging interests and the willingness to work in various different areas over the course of the placement. It may suit someone who wants to understand &#39;engineering&#39; in a real&#45;world, small company context, or who has no strong feelings yet about their career direction and wants to experience multiple areas of work.<br /><br />Feedback from student:<br />The internship was very enjoyable and was very fruitful from the wide range of tasksit offered. Working closely with a small, highly experienced team also meant that I was able to learn from their expertise. The commute everyday however was quite lengthly and was the only draw back for me.

They are also designers and installers of floating floor systems. <br /><br />They fabricate and install a wide range of products to attenuate vibration in building structures. Some applications are lightweight and small, some are significant relating to entire structure isolation.<br /><br />Likely exposure to design of elements such as floating floors which required AutoCAD. Exposure to vibration theory and application. Also time spent in office environment handling and packing orders. Application based engineering. Potential for some site work.<br /><br />IIA student feedback: 	&#39;Working at Mason was quite a lovely experience &#45; it is a small team (10 ish people total) that is a subsidiary to a big firm in the US, hence I got to work on really large and interesting projects while keeping the small friendly team approach. It can be extremely busy at times, but in a satisfying manner &#45; they do not expect you to stay any longer than the work day and the whole team was always very understanding of the many questions I had. <br />As of writing, it is located a bit in the middle of nowhere, so unless you have a car or find a place to stay in Farnham (or nearby other train stations?) I would not recommend it.  Moreover, as it is quite a small company, I ended up doing a big range of different tasks, some more interesting than others.

It was overwhelming at first but you quicky settle into the Mclaren lifestyle and understand how the business functions. Despite being a large company, you quickly form a bond with the team you are placed in and they respect you as a colleague. It is a great place to help you decide what you want to speacialise in as it is easy to get switched onto projects that you are interested in due to the diverse disciplines of engineering in the company.

	<td>Consulting Civil & Structural Engineers<br />Every project has an assigned team experienced in the work undertaken and focus on producing economic and practical designs.<br /><br />Reuby & Stagg have invested in sophisticated computer aided design and drafting software such as 3D finite element analysis PDS ground modelling, WinDes &#45; drainage design and Revit 3D modelling to enable the engineering options to be fully optimised.  This accurately addresses the design parameters in order to provide an efficient and cost effective final solution.<br /><br />IB student feedback: My internship was only two weeks long so i didn&#39;t have much time to get to know the company, however I really enjoyed it. I was given a building at the beginning of the two weeks and every day/every couple of days I looked at and designed a different component of the building. I got to use software we haven&#39;t used at uni and also spend time in an office&#45;based environment, both of which I really enjoyed.
